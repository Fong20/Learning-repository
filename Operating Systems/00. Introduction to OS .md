# Introduction to OS
Operating system is an intermediary between software and hardware. It allows the software to access the hardware

## Main function of OS
There are two main functions of operating system

  ### Abstraction 
  - It hides the complexity of the hardware and provides a clean interface for users to use the resources. (Eg: if we want to access a file, we only need to click on the file as the operating system helps us to perform all the complex task behind the scene to retrieve the particular file from the hard disk / solid state drive.
  
  ### Resource manager
  - Operating system manages all resources of the computer such as the memory, storage etc
  - Provides an efficient and fair use of resources (control the access of software to the computer resources)

## Computer system architecture
There are two types of computer system architecture which are **general purpose system** and **special purpose system.
**
  ### Special purpose systems
  - Example of special purpose systems are embedded systems and handheld systems.

    ### Embedded systems
    - They are designed to perform very specific task
    - It has little to no user interface
    - Example: printer, scanner, robotic arms etc

    ### Handheld system
    - It is small in size and has limited resources (smaller memory, slower processers)
    - Common operating systems used in handheld systems include Android, IOS, Windows and Symbian.
    - Example: smartphone, tablets, PDA etc

## Hardware Virtualization
- A framework of dividing resources of a computer to multiple environments (virtual machines). Thus, it allows different operating systems to run on a single computer concurrently.
- In short, virtualization is a technique used to run multiple operating systems concurrently in different environments on a single device.
- There are two types of virtualization which are hardware and software.

  ### Important terms
  - Host OS = original OS which is installed in the computer
  - Guest OS = new OS which is installed through virtual machine
  - virtual machine = an environment which is created through virtualization.
    
  ### Benefits of hardware virtualizaton
  - Server consolidation. Different services that used to run on different machines can now run on a single machine.
  - Testing of programs in a separate environment secured from the original environment (Eg: sandbox development)
  - A system is protected from other systems running on the same machine.

  ### Hypervisor
- It is a **software which allows us to create a virtual machine** by **abstracting hardware resources from the actual machine to be used virtually by another guest machine and the operating system they run on.**
- There are two types of hypervisor (Type 1 and Type 2)

    ### Type 1 hypervisior (bare-metal hypervisor)
    - In a type 1 hypervisor, a layer of software is installed directly on top of the physical hardware
    - The client side hypervisor runs the server hypervisor. The server hypervisor software is installed directly on top of the physical hardware of the physical server.
    - There is no software or operating system in between.
    - Used for client and server.
    - Example: VMware vSphere with ESX/ESXI, Kernel based virtual machine (KVM), Microsoft Hyper-V

    ### Type 2 hypervisor
    - The host OS runs the hypervisor to create virtual machines.
    - The virtual machine makes the guest OS to believe that they are running on the device's hardware but they are actually running as a user-level application through the host OS.
    - Example: Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation pro / VMware Fusion.

    ### Type 1 vs Type 2 hypervisor
    - Type 1 hypervisor is more efficient than type 2 hypervisor as type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the device's hardware.
    - However, the downside of type 1 hypervisor is that we have to tweak some changes to the hypervisor if there are changes to the hardware.
    - Type 2 hypervisor is easier to install as it runs on the host OS. As a result, we do not need to worry about the effects of hardware changes towards the hypervisor.

## Software virtualization
- In Software virtualization, virtualization is done through an application.
- Eg: compiler (Java virtual machine)

  ### Benefits of software virtualization
  - It isolates the application from the underlying architecture
  - It helps to create protable application that can run on different architectures. All you need is the JVM installed to existing architecture to run the application
