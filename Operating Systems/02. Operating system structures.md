# 02. Operating system structures

## Kernel
- The kernel is the core of the OS that manages operations of computer and hardware.
- It does not directly interact with the users, it focusses on interacting with the hardware
- It also provide services to all other parts of the OS
- The **kernel is the first part of the OS which will be loaded into the main memory when the computer starts** A small piece of code, also known as the **bootstrap program will locate the kernel and load the kernel into the main memory to be executed.**
- The **process of loading the kernel is known as booting.** 
- It prevents other unecessary services from being loaded into the main memory (RAM)

  Important terms
  Kernel space
  - It is all the components which are below the system call.
  - All processes are executed in the kernel space
  - The kernel is loaded into the protected area of the memory whereby no other programs can overwrite the kernel space.
    anything above the system call is the user space

  ### System structure
  - Refers to the kernel's structure (How the components inside the kernel are structured and organized)
  - The structure of a kernel can affect the performance, stability, debugging & maintenance and ehnancements of an OS.
 
    ### Monolithic kernel
    - In a monolithic kernel, all important components are fitted into the kernel space and operates at the kernel space
    - Each component is free to call other components located in the same layer
   
      ### Advantages
      1. Efficiency: Monolithic kernels are generally faster than other types of kernels because they don’t have to switch between user and kernel modes for every system call, which can cause overhead.
      2. Tight integration: Since all the operating system services are running in kernel space, they can communicate more efficiently with each other, making it easier to implement complex functionalities and optimizations.
      3. Simplicity: Monolithic kernels are simpler to design, implement, and debug than other types of kernels because they have a unified structure that makes it easier to manage the code.
      4. Lower latency: Monolithic kernels have lower latency than other types of kernels because system calls and interrupts can be handled directly by the kernel.
   
      ### Disadvantages
      1. Stability issues: Monolithic kernels can be less stable than other types of kernels because any bug or security vulnerability in a kernel service can affect the entire system.
      2. Security vulnerabilities: Since all the operating system services are running in kernel space, any security vulnerability in one of the services can compromise the entire system.
      3. Maintenance difficulties: Monolithic kernels can be more difficult to maintain than other types of kernels because any change in one of the services can affect the entire system.
      4. Limited modularity: Monolithic kernels are less modular than other types of kernels because all the operating system services are tightly integrated into the kernel space. This makes it harder to add or remove functionality without affecting the entire system.

    ### Microkernel
    - Microkernel has a **simpler structure and is more minimalist as it removes non-essential components from the kernel and only keeps the crucial ones.**
    - Its main function is to **manage the inter-process communication between programs and various services which run in the user space**
   
      message passing = Allows user-level processes to communicate with the microkernel. Communication between different parts of the operating system is typically done using message passing, rather than shared memory. This provides a more secure and reliable way to exchange information between processes, and helps prevent bugs and errors from propagating throughout the system.

      ### Advantages
      1. Reliability: Microkernel architecture is designed to be more reliable than monolithic kernels. Since most of the operating system services run outside the kernel space, any bug or security vulnerability in a service won’t affect          the entire system.
      2. Flexibility: Microkernel architecture is more flexible than monolithic kernels because it allows different operating system services to be added or removed without affecting the entire system.
      3. Modularity: Microkernel architecture is more modular than monolithic kernels because each operating system service runs independently of the others. This makes it easier to maintain and debug the system.
      4. Portability: Microkernel architecture is more portable than monolithic kernels because most of the operating system services run outside the kernel space. This makes it easier to port the operating system to different hardware architectures.

      ### Disadvantages:
      1. Performance: Microkernel architecture can be slower than monolithic kernels because it requires more context switches between user space and kernel space.
      2. Complexity: Microkernel architecture can be more complex than monolithic kernels because it requires more communication and synchronization mechanisms between the different operating system services.
      3. Development difficulty: Developing operating systems based on microkernel architecture can be more difficult than developing monolithic kernels because it requires more attention to detail in designing the communication and synchronization mechanisms between the different services.
      4. Higher resource usage: Microkernel architecture can use more system resources, such as memory and CPU, than monolithic kernels because it requires more communication and synchronization mechanisms between the different operating system services.

    ### Modules / Modular kernel
    - Modular kernel is creatd by using object-oriented programming techniques
    - Each module is separated and can communicate with one another via a well-defined interface

    ### Hybrid Kernel 
    It is the combination of both monolithic kernel and microkernel. It has speed and design of monolithic kernel and modularity and stability of microkernel.

      ### Advantages:
      1. Performance: Hybrid kernels can offer better performance than microkernels because they reduce the number of context switches required between user space and kernel space.
      2. Reliability: Hybrid kernels can offer better reliability than monolithic kernels because they isolate drivers and other kernel components in separate protection domains.
      3. Flexibility: Hybrid kernels can offer better flexibility than monolithic kernels because they allow different operating system services to be added or removed without affecting the entire system.
      4. Compatibility: Hybrid kernels can be more compatible than microkernels because they can support a wider range of device drivers.

      ### Disadvantages:
1. Complexity: Hybrid kernels can be more complex than monolithic kernels because they include both monolithic and microkernel components, which can make the design and implementation more difficult.
2. Security: Hybrid kernels can be less secure than microkernels because they have a larger attack surface due to the inclusion of monolithic components.
3. Maintenance: Hybrid kernels can be more difficult to maintain than microkernels because they have a more complex design and implementation.
4. Resource usage: Hybrid kernels can use more system resources than microkernels because they include both monolithic and microkernel components.
