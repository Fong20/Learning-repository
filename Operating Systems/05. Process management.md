# 05. Process management

## Concept of a process
- Process are programs which are currently being executed (currently running)
- A program becomes a process after the executable file is loaded into the memory
- Some standby tasks (interruption) are performed to run the executable file.

  ### Information of a process
  - text (program code)
  - stack
  - data
  - heap

Note: Although two processes may be associated with the same program, thay are considred as two separate processes 

## Process control block (PCB)
- PCB is also known as the task control block (TCB).
- It is the id of the process, each process in the OS is represented by a PCB.
- The PCB is created and managed by the OS

## Process states
- new
- ready
- running
- waiting
- terminated

Note:
- Only one process can be in running state on a single processing core at any instant (
- If there are additional processes which are waiting to be processed by the processor, it can be in either the ready state or waiting state
