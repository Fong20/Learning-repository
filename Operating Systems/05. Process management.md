# 05. Process management

## Process
  ### Concept of a process
  - Process are **programs which are currently being executed (currently running)**
  - A program becomes a process when standby tasks (interruption) are performed to run the executable file and the executable file is loaded into the memory.
  - Therefore, a process has to be created in order for the program to run
  -  There can be multiple processes from the same program. Although two processes may be associated with the same program, thay are considred as two separate processes (Example: when we run two chrome web browsers, the program code will be identical but the data, heap and stack sessions will be different)
  
  ### Information in a process
  Generally, a process contains the program code and other information. The information can be divided into four sections:
  - text (program code)
  - stack
  - data
  - heap
  
    ### Text
    - Contains the program code
    - It also contains the current activity represented by the value of the program counter
   
    ### Stack
    Contains temporary data, such as function parameters, return addresses and local variables

    ### Data 
    Contains the global variable

    ### Heap 
    Dynamically allocates memory to process during its run time

  ### Process states
  As a process is being executed, it changes state. The process could be in one of the following states:
  - New: Newly Created Process (or) being-created process.
  - Ready: After the creation, process moves to the Ready state, i.e. the process is waiting to be assigned to the processor for execution.
  - Run: The process is executed in CPU (only one process at a time can be under execution in a single processor)
  - Wait (or Block): The process is waiting for some events to occur.
  - Complete (or Terminated): The process completed its execution.

  Note:
  - Only one process can be in running state on a single processing core at any instant (
  - If there are additional processes which are waiting to be processed by the processor, it can be in either the ready state or waiting state

## Process control block (PCB)
- A process control block (PCB) is a **data structure used by operating systems to store important information about running processes.**
- PCB is also known as the task control block (TCB).
- It acts as the **identofication for each process, each process in the OS is represented by a PCB.**
- The PCB is created and managed by the OS

  ### Components of a PCB

## Process table
The process table is **an array of PCBs, which means it logically contains a PCB for all of the current processes in the system.**
