# 08. Storage management

Methods to allocate space to file
1. Contiguous
2. Linked
3. Indexed

## Contiguous allocation
Contiguous allocation requires each file to be occupied to a set of blocks on the hard disk

## Linked allocation
- Linked allocation solves the problem of contigous allocation
- In linked allocation, each file is a linked list of disk blocks and the disk blocks may be scattered anywhere on the hard disk.
- Each directory contains a pointer to the first and last block of the
- Each block contains a pointer to the next block
- Disadvantage of linked allocation is that it occupies some of the block space. Some of the space needs to be occupied to store the pointer that points to the next block in the list.

## Indexed allocation


## Free space management
- Is the management of the available disk space / unused disk space.
- The free-space list is used to locate the free space to store the files by recording all the free disk blocks.

  **Creating a file**
- Before a file can be created, it needs to search through the free-space list for the required amount of disk space.
- Once the amount of required space is determined, the available space is then allocated to the file and the used space is removed from the free space list.

  Deleting a file
  When a file is deleted, the free disk space is added into the free-space list

  **Methods of implementing free-space list:**
  1. bit vector
  2. linked list
  3. counting (use contiguous allocation method)
