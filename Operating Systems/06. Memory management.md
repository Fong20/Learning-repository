- Whenever we launch a program, the program must be brought from the hard disk to the main memory before being assigned to the CPU to be executed.
- Main memory and CPU registers are the only storage medium which can be directly accessed by the CPU.
- The main function of memory management is the allocation of memory.  (Bring the processes into main memory for execution by the CPU)

Besides the main function, there are also 5 principle requirements which memory management must satisfy:
1. Protection
2. Relocation
3. Sharing
4. Logical organization
5. Physical organization
   
## Protection
- Ensures that each process is allocated its own unique memory address and memory space. No two processes have the same memory address. This protects the process against unwanted interference by other processes.
- Processes are only able to access other processes if they are able to obtain the process's memory address


  **How is memory address allocated to a process?**
  Memory address is allocated to a process by using two registers, the base register and the limit register. 
  
  Base register: starting address of a process
  
  Limit register: length of a process (provides the amount of memory space allocated to the process)

  Example:

  The instructions of the process follow the memory address. As the memory address starts from 300000, the instructions will have address of 300000, 300001, 300002 etc

  Protection is acheived by comparing the every memory address generated in user mode with the values in the registers

## Relocation
- Generally, the main memory is shared among a large number of processes
- What if there are waiting processes in the memory? Swapping is a method in which it temporarily swaps off a process in a waiting state from the main memory to the backing store. The process will then be brought back into the memory to continue its execution. backing store = virtual memory
- The purpose of doing so is to provide th CPU scheduler with a large pool of ready processes to select
- However, the program may not be placed back in the same memory location once it is swapped out. The process must be flexible such that it can be relocated and still continue to run.
  



To solve the issue, address binding is performed at the execution time. Address binding is the mapping of one address space to another address space. A relocation register is required to store the actual starting address (original address) of a process. The value of the relocation register is then added to the logical address to ontain the physical address

Whenever the application is run, the CPU will generate a logical address.

logical address + relocation register (address before relocate/original address) = actual physical address

## Sharing
Some processes which are cooperating to perform a task may need access to the same data structure. Hence, memory management needs to allow controlled access to shared areas of the memory without compromising essential protection

**There are two types of working set:**
1. Private working set = the amount of memory used by the process, which cannot be shared with other processes
2. Working set = the amount of memory used by a process, which also includes the memory shared by other processes

## Logical organization
- Memory management also needs to allow the sharing of modules or libraries
- Stub is a small piece of code which indicates how to locate the appropriate class libraries in the memory, or load the class libraries if they are not found in the memory.
Logical organization = process of generating a logical address. It is done by the CPU

## Physical organization
Memory management also needs to organize the flow of information between the main and secondary memory which run at dfferent speeds.

## Memory partitioning
The operating system occupies some fixed position of the main memory, and the remaining amount of memory is allocated to other processes.

There are two types of memory partitioning
1. Contiguous
2. Non-contiguous

  ### Fragmentation
  Fragmentation is free memory space which are too small to be used by other processes. As a result, the memory space is wasted as it is unused.

  **There are two types of fragmentation**
  1. Internal fragmentation = only occurs in fixed partition
  2. External fragmentation = only occurs in dynamic partition
     
  ### Fixed partitioning
  In fixed partitioning, the memory is divided into fixed, equal size or variable size partitions.

  Advantages
  - simplicity. The memory space is divided into several fixed, equal-size or variable size partitions
    
  Disadvantages
  - Occurence of internal fragmentation. This can be fixed by using fixed, but variable size partitions and assign the process to the smallest partition which it can fit.

  ### Dynamic partitioning
  - In dynamic partitioning, the memory space is allocated to the process based on exactly how much memory the process requires. 
  - The memory is not partitioned into fixed size and could be in different sizes.
  - External fragmentation occurs in dynamic partitioning. 

    ### Compaction
    - Compaction is a method used to solve external fragmentation.
    - However, it is time consuming as the OS needs to rearrange the processes to make them contiguous.
    - Hence, it is better to make use and fill in the free memory gaps smartly to reduce external fragmentation by using several algorithms.
   
    **Algorithms:**
    1. First fit = Searches the memory for free gap from the beginning and stops searching when the process is able to be fit in the empty gap.
    2. Next-fit = Searches the memory for free space from the location where the first-fit search ended
    3. Best fit = Searches through the entire memory for free gaps and allocates the smallest gap which is enough to fit in the process.
    4. Worst fit = Searches through the entire memory for free gaps and allocates the largest gap to fit in the process.

    The ideal algorithms are next-fit and best-fit as it still provides plenty of free memory space whereas worst-fit is the worst algorithm
