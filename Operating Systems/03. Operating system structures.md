# Operating system structures

## Kernel
- The kernel is the core of the OS
- It does not directly interact with the users, it focusses on interacting with the hardware
- It also provide services to all other parts of the OS
- The kernel will be loaded into the main memory when the computer starts, the process of loading the kernel is known as booting.
- It prevents other unecessary services from being loaded into the main memory (RAM)

  ### System structure
  - refers to the kernel's structure (How the components inside the kernel are structured and organized)
 
    ### Monolithic
    All important components are fitted into one single layer
    Each component is free to call other components located in the same layer

    anything below system call is kernel
    anything above the system call is the user space

    Monolithic structure is faster in terms of passing information
    
    ### Microkernel
    - Removing non-essential components from the kernel, it only keeps the crucial ones.

    ### Modules
    - uses object-oriented programming techniques
   
    ### Hybrid kernel
    - Is the combination of monolithic and microkernel structure
