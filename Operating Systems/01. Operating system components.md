# Operating system components
standardization for all manufacturers to follow

- user interface
- system calls
- kernel services ( Eg: program execution / I/0 operation / file system / communication / resource allocation / accounting / error detection / protection and security )

## Operating system user interface
There are two types of OS interfacaae
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Command line interface (CLI) = a TUI (Text-based User Interface) which uses just text. It has no visual elements like buttons and such and can only be interacted with plain text.

## Three essential components of an OS
- memory management
- process management 
- storage management

  ### Process management
  - A **process is a program in execution**
  - In order to execute a program, it requires resources. Hence, OS helps to allocate the right amount of resources (memory etc) to execute the program
  - Not only thatm it also creates and deletes process, pause and resume process and provide mechanism for process communication.
  - The CPU is the hardware component which executes all the processes.

    ### Process scheduling
    Process scheduling determines the sequence of executing processes (who goes first)
    
    This is done through different algorithms
    - first come first serve
    - shortest job first
    - priority scheduling
    - round robin

## Memory management
- Determines what processes to be stored in the memory. This optimizes CPU utilization and computer response to users.
- The OS keeps track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
- It also **decides which processes and data to be moved into and out of the memory** by allocating and de-allocating memory space as needed

## Storage management
- control the storage of files

  OS activities:
  - manipulate files and directories
  - free space management
  - allocation of free space
  - file size limitations

## Other components

  ## Distributed system
  Distributed system is a collection of physically separated computer systems that are connected together

  ## Protection and security
  - Operating systems must have the necessary mechanisms for the protection and security of computer systems
  - This can be done by **controlling the authorization of accessing different resources** and **incoporating asymmetric and symmetric encryption.**
