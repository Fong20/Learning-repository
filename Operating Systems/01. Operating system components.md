# Operating system components
standardization for all manufacturers to follow

- user interface
- system calls
- program execution / I/0 operation / file system / communication / resource allocation / acc

## Operating system user interface]
There are two types of implementation
- GUI
- CLI

## Three essential components of an OS
- memory management
- process management 
- storage management

  ### Process management
  - A process is a program in execution
  - In order to run a program, it requires resources
  - Hence, OS helps to allocate the right amount of resources to execute the program
  - The CPU is the main hardware in charge to

  
  Process scheduling = Determines the sequence of execution of processes ( who goes first)
  This is done through different algorithms
  - first come first serve
  - shortest job first
  - priority scheduling
  - round robin

## Memory management
- Determines what processes to be stored in the memory
- The OS keeps track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
- It also decides which processes and data to be moved into and out of the memory by allocating and de-allocating memory space as needed

## Storage management
- control the storage of files

## Other components

  ## Distributed system
  Distributed system is a collection of physically separated computer systems that are connected together

  ## Protection and security
  - Operating systems must have the necessary mechanisms for the protection and security of computer systems
  - This can be done by controlling the authorization of accessing different resources and incoporating asymmetric andsymmetric encryption.
