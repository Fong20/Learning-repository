# 04. User interface, system calls and services

## User interface
Many operating systems currently include both command line interface nad graphical user interface

There are two main types of implementation
- command line interface
- graphical user interface

  ### Command line interpreter
  - Its primary function is to **fetch commands from the user and execute the command.**
  - The commands could be **built-in commands** or **system program commands to locate the file, load the file and execute the file.**

    **Example of built-in commands:**
    - ipconfig
    - ping
    - ping -6
    - tracert
    - netstat
    - telnet
    - javac (used to compile java source code into bytecode)
    - java (used to execute the bytecode into machine code)
 
  ### Why CLI?
  - Faster remote access
  - It is easier to execute certain functions in the CLI as compared to GUI
  - Automate complex tasks such as batch processing

  ### Batch processing
  - Batch processing is the method computers use to periodically complete high-volume, repetitive data jobs.
  - Batch processing runs on command line interface

  ### Graphical user interface (GUI)
  - GUI is more user friendly as it allows the user to interact through the usage of icons. The user can click on the icon to access the particualr function

## Interaction between I/0 and operating system
- Most modern OS are **interrupt driven which means the user's input will interrupt the operating system to execute a process**
- When there is event (user provides input), an interrupt is generated. The OS will deal with the interrupt and determine the action to be taken
- When there are no processes to execute, or no I/O devices, or no response from the user, the OS will remain idle.

## Operating system services
- Services are required for the execution of programs
- If there is **no particular OS system calls to access the OS services**, the **particular program cannot be executed.**

Example:
File management system call is required to access the file system manipulation services in order to execute the file manipulation and modification programs.

## System calls
- A computer program **cannot directly access the computer hardware resources**, it needs to **go through the operating system.** System call is a **programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel** of the operating system it is executed on. Hence, it is **a way for programs to interact with the operating system.**
- System calls are usually written in C/C++

  ### System calls and dual mode operation
  Modern CPU has two modes of operation:
  - user mode = CPU can **only execute non-privilege instructions**
  - kernel mode = CPU can **execute all instructions (privilege and non-previlege)**
  - If **any applications requires the OS to conduct privilege instructions**, it needs to **make a system call to access the kernel mode**
  - Otherwise, if the user program **does not require the OS to perform privilege instructions**, then **no system call is performed.**

  ### System calls and API
  - System call provides the operating system services to the program through an Application program interface (API)
  - API = class library
  - Each system call is associated with a number. To access a particular service, it needs to search for the system call number in the table and return the services
  - API is used instead of native system calls as a program is not required to know how the system call is being implemented but by only following the API and understand what it will return.
