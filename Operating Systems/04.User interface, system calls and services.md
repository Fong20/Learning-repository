# 04. User interface, system calls and services

## User interface
There are two main types of implementation
- command line interface
- graphical user interface

  ### Command line interpreter
  - Its primary function is to **fetch commands from the user and execute the command.**
  - The commands could be **built-in commands** or **system program commands to locate the file, load the file and execute the file.**

    **Example of built-in commands:**
    - ipconfig
    - ping
    - ping -6
    - tracert
    - netstat
    - telnet
    - javac (used to compile java source code into bytecode)
    - java (used to execute the bytecode into machine code)
 
  ### Why CLI?
  - Faster remote access
  - It is easier to execute certain functions in the CLI as compared to GUI
  - Automate complex tasks such as batch processing

  ### Graphical user interface (GUI)

    

  
  

## System calls
- Whenever the apllication wants to access the hardware resources, the system calls acts as an interpreter which will carry messages from the application to access the services layer
- They are mostly accessed by programs via a high-level application program interface (API)
- API = class library
- Each system call is associated with a number

  ## Types of system calls

  Modern CPU has two modes of operation:
  - user mode = CPU can only execute non-privilege instructions
  - kernel mode = CPU can execute all instructions ( privilege and non-previlege)
  - If any applications requires the OS to conduct privilege instructions, it needs to make a system call to access the kernel mode
  - Otherwise, if the user program does not require the OS to perform privilege instructions, then no system call is performed.
 
    context switch = eats up CPU

## Interaction between I/O and operating system
- Modern operating systems are interrupt driven = the user will interrupt the system to perform a taskThey


## Operating system services
Services are required for the execution of programs
If there is no particular OS system calls to access the OS services, the particular program cannot be executed.

Example:
File management system call is required to access the file system manipulation services in order to execute the file manipulation and modification programs.
