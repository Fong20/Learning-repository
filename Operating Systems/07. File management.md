# 07. File management

## Types of storage management
1. storage space management (storage which has been occupied)
2. free space management (free storage which has not been occupied)

## File system
**File system is a collection of files which are organized in a way that the operating system can manage them.** It consists of two parts which are the files and the directory structure (information of the files)

## File
- File is a logical storage unit
- A file has a certain structure which depends on its type (Eg: text file, source file, executable file etc)

## Directory structure
- The directory structure stores the information of the file
- It is located inside the secondary storage

## Storage addressing system
Components of a hard disk
- platter
- sector
- track
- arm
- head

  ### Cylinder head sector addressing (CHS)
  - Cylinder head sector is one of the older methods which is used to determine the address of the file
  - Check the file is located in which platter, followed by the track, and finally the sector

  ### Logical block addressing (LBA)
  - Introduced to replace the old cylinder head sector addressing (CHS)
  - In logical block addressing, the hard disk drive / whole storage system is divided into many logical blocks (allocation units/clusters) and each block is assigned with a unique number. The number is then used as an address to the hard disk and it counts the existing blocks starting from zero.
  - This addressing method is simpler and more efficient as compared to CHS
  - 1 block = 1 cluster
  - 1 sector = 512 bytes
  - 1 cluster = 2 sectors (1024 bytes)
  - Allocating the ideal block size is very important since the remaining unused blocks which are not occupied by a file are will cause internal fragmentation.
  - Generally, we use smaller block size to minimize internal fragmentation. The ideal block size is 1024 bytes (1 Kb) to 4096 bytes (4Kb).
  - Assuming a file needs 1500 bytes of storage space and each block size is 1024 bytes, we cannot just assign a block as it is not enough to fit in the file. Thus, we need to allocate 2 blocks to store the file. The remaining block (2048-1500 = 548 bytes) are wasted and known as fragmentation

## Access method
The access method determines how the file is accessed and read into the memory

  ### Sqeuential access
  - It is the simplest and most common method
  - In this method, information is processed in order

  ### Direct access
  - In direct address, programs are allowed to read and write records repidly in no particular order
  - The block that contains the required information is determined, and the information is read from that block directly.

  **Example:**

  ### Index
  - The index is built on top of the direct-access method
  - Each index is associated with a pointer. To search for a particular file, just search the index of the desired information and then use the pointer to access the file.

## Storage space management
- Determines how the storage space is allocated too utilize the hard disk efficiently and ensure that the files can be accessed quickly.

  **Types of storage allocation method**
  1. Contiguous
  2. Non-contiguous (Linked list, indexed)

  ### Contiguous allocation
  - In contiguous allocation, it requires each file to occupy a set of contiguous blocks (sequential order).
  - We can use the same algorithms such as first fit, next fit, best fit and worst fit to determine the allocation of the files in the hard disk

  **Example:**

  Each block can store up to 4KB of data.

  **Utilizing first fit algorithm**

  **Utilizing worst fit algorithm**

  In this case, worst fit algorithm is better than first fit algorithm since all the files can be stored inside the hard disk. However, there is an internal fragmentation of 2KB (0.5 x 4)

  ### Linked allocation
  - In linked allocation, the file is stored in blocks which are scattered anywhere on the hard disk. This allows the file to be stored in any free available blocks
  - A directory contains a pointer to the first and last block of the file and each of the blocks contain a pointer to the next block
  - However, the disadvantage of linked allocation is it will take up the actual storage space. This is because some of the block space has to be allocated to store the pointer thatpoints to the next block in the list. Eg: if each block is 512 bytes and the pointer requires 4 bytes. The actual block size to store the file is 508 bytes.

  **Diagram which shows the difference between contiguous allocation and linked allocation**

  **Example question:**

  Each block can store up to 4 KB of data and 0.5 KB needs to be used to store the pointer. Thus, the actual block size to store the file is only 3.5 KB.

  **Using first fit algorithm**

  ### Indexed allocation
  - In index allocation, all the pointers are stored in a single block which is known as an index block.
  - Index size = Pointer size x Number of pointers
  - If the index size is too small, it is not able to hold enough pointers for a large file. If the index size is too big, it produces more overhead

## Free space management
- Determines the available free space to store files and resuse the space from deleted files
- The available free space in a hard disk can be located by using a free space list which records all the free disk blocks.
- Before a file is created, it needs to search the free space list if the required amount of space is available. If the space is available, the space is allocated to the new file and the used space is removed from the free-space list
- When a file is deleted, the available disk space is added into the free-space list.

  **There are thee types of free-space list:**
  1. Bit vector / Bit map
  2. Linked list
  3. Counting

  ### Bit vector / Bit map
  - In bit vector / bit map, each block is represented by a binary bit (0 or 1)
  - 0 represents that the block has been allocated
  - 1 represents that the block is free
  - bit vector size = block size / disk size
  - A downside of bit vector / bit map is it requires space to keep the bit map / bit vector

    ### Linked list
    - works similar to the link allocation in which it links all the free blocks
    - The first free block has a pointer which points to the second free block and the second free block pointer points to the third free block and the cycle continues
  
    ### Counting
    Works similar to the contiguous allocation where it keeps the address of the first free block, and the number of free contiguous blocks that follow the first block
