# 07. File management

## Logical block addressing (LBA)
- Introduced to replace the old cylinder head sector addressing (CHS)
- 1 sector = 512 bytes
- 1 cluster = 2 sectors (1024 bytes)
- 1 block = 1 cluster
- Generally, we use smaller block size to minimize internal fragmentation. The ideal block size is 1024 to 4096.

## Access method
- Determines how the file is accessed and read into the memory

  ### Sqeuential access
  - It is the simplest and most common method
  - In this method, information is processed in order
