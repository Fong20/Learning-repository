# 08. Operating system security

## Function of operating system security
- prevent unauthorized users from accessing the system or certain files
- Prevent system from attacks (internal or external)
- Prevent third party from stealing information

Operating system provides security through two methods:
1. authentication
2. authorization

## Authentication
- Authentication is the process of controlling a user's access to the computer
- The operating system authenticates the user's identity by using a username and password

  ### Hashing
  Hashing is a method which is used to increase the. This is done by transforming a given key or string into a fix sized value

## Authorization
- In a computer system, it consists of subjects (user, process, etc) and objects (hardware such as CPU, memory, printers, etc & software such as files, programs)
- Authorization controls the user's access to system's data by deciding what operations can be conducted / resources can be accessed by the subject
- A subject can only perform operations / access resources for which it has authorization
- Authorization can be expressed in the form access control matrix (ACM), access control list or capability list.

  ### Access control matrix (ACM)
  - Access control matrix is a data table which is used to specify the permissions of each subject for each object.
  - The rows of the matrix represent the subjects, whereas the columns represent objects.
  - Every matrix cell reflects a set of access rights granted to the subject to access the objects. It is possible for a subject can have more than one access rights to an object.
  - One downside of storing the entire ACM is it would require a large amount of memory space to be stored. Thus, access control list (ACL) and capability list is used.

  ### Access control list (ACL)
  - **Access control list is a list which is attached to the object and shows only the users who are authorized to perform certain operations on the object**
  - It is easier to determine who has access to the file/program. However, it is difficult to see the full access rights of a user.

    **How does the process access a file?**
    - When a process is trying to access a file, it will first read the ACL list

    **Removing access rights in ACL**
    - It is easier to remove all access rights by using ACL
    - However, it is difficult to remove all access rights of a particular user

  ### Capability list (C-list)
  - **The capability list is a list which is attached to the subject and shows the list of objects that a user is authorized to access and operate**
  - The advantage of capability list is it is easier to see the full access right of a user. However, the disadvantage is it is difficult to determine all the users who can access the file/program

   **How does the process access a file?**
    - When a process is trying to access a file, it will first read the C-list

    **Removing access rights in C-list**
    - It is easier to remove all access rights of a particular user by using C-list
    - However, it is difficult to remove all the user's access rights to a particular object

  ### ACL vs C-list
  Both ACL and C-list are stored in a protected area which is in the kernel space

  ### Role based access control (RBAC)
  - Although using ACL and C-List requires less memory space to be stored as compared to ACM, it can still create many entries if there are a lot of users which cause the size of the list to be huge. It also makes the setup of access rights for each user harder. Thus, role based access control (RBAC) is used to rectify the issue.
  - RBAC uses one of the following methods (ACM, ACL or C-list) with the additional implementation of roles. It works by assigning users to different roles and provides access rights based on the role provided.

## Principle of least privilege
- Principle of least privilege states that a user or entity should only be given adequate privileges to perform their tasks. This could be done by limiting the user's access to data, resources and applications.
- This improves damage control since if one of the user's account with minimal privilege is compromised, the attacker will not be able to access or perform additional damage to other files since he/she does not have the required access rights.
- Moreover, it also prevents users from misusing critical systems and data.
