# 08. Operating system security

## Function of operating system security
- prevent unauthorized users from accessing the system or certain files
- Prevent system from attacks (internal or external)
- Prevent third party from stealing information

Operating system provides security through two methods:
1. authentication
2. authorization

## Authentication
- Authentication is the process of controlling a user's access to the computer
- The operating system authenticates the user's identity by using a username and password

  ### Hashing
  Hashing is a method which is used to increase the. This is done by transforming a given key or string into a fix sized value

## Authorization
- In a computer system, it consists of subjects (user, process, etc) and objects (hardware such as CPU, memory, printers, etc & software such as files, programs)
- Authorization controls the user's access to system's data by deciding what operations can be conducted / resources can be accessed by the subject
- A subject can only perform operations / access resources for which it has authorization
- Authorization can be expressed in the form access control matrix (ACM), access control list or capability list.

  ### Access control matrix (ACM)
  - Access control matrix is a data table which is used to specify the permissions of each subject for each object.
  - The rows of the matrix represent the subjects, whereas the columns represent objects.
  - Every matrix cell reflects a set of access rights granted to the subject to access the objects. It is possible for a subject can have more than one access rights to an object.
  - One downside of storing the entire ACM is it would require a large amount of memory space to be stored. Thus, access control list (ACL) and capability list is used.

  ### Access control list (ACL)
  - Access control list is a list which is attached to the object and contains only the users who are authorized to perform certain operations on the object
  - It is easier to determine who has access to the file/program. However, it is difficult to see the full access rights of a user.

    **How does the process access a file?**
    - When a process is trying to access a file, it will first read the ACL list

  ### Capability list (C-list)
  - The capability list is a list which is attached to the subject and shows the list of objects that a user is authorized to access and operate
  - The advantage of capability list is it is easier to see the full access right of a user. However, the disadvantage is it is difficult to determine all the users who can access the file/program

   **How does the process access a file?**
    - When a process is trying to access a file, it will first read the C-list

  ### ACL vs C-list
  Both ACL and C-list are stored in a protected area which is in the kernel space
