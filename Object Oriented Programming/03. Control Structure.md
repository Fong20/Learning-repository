# 03. Control Structure

## Selection statement
- Used when we only want to execute some code if a condition is met.

## Condition statement
- A conditional statement is just a statement that can result in either true or false. 
- Conditional statements can be combined with logical AND, or logical OR, to form a new, compound conditional statement.

## If statement
- If statement provides the application some intelligence as it can now make decisions and do different things depending on various conditions.
- If the condition is satisfied, the code will be executed 

### Syntax:

```scala
if (condition) then
  code
end if
```

## If else statement
In if else statement,  the code in the else statement will be executed if the first condition is not satisfied

### Syntax:

```scala
if (condition) then
  code
else
  code
end if
```

## If elseif else statement

### Syntax:

```scala
if (condition1) then
  code
else if (condition2) then
  code
else
end if
```

## Match statement
- Another alternative to if else if statement would be the match statement. This is similar to java's switch case
- scala is able to identify if the value and data type matches

### Syntax:

```scala
variable_name match
  case1 =>
    code

  case2 =>
    code 

  case3 =>
    code

  case_ =>
    code

end match
```

## Iteration statements

## For loop
- In scala, the for loop consists of three components which are the generator, definition, and filter
- The generator must have a variable and a list, where the list may be any expression resulting in a list.
- A definition has the form variable = expression (the keywords var and val are not used here).
- A filter has the form if condition

### Syntax:

```scala
for( var x <- Range ) do
   statement(s);
end for
```

### Examples

```scala
for (i <- Array(1,2,3)) do //This is the generator
  println(i)
end for
```

```scala
for (i <- 1.to(5)) do //This is the generator, the .to function provides a collection of range of numbers from 1 to 5
  println(i)
end for
```

```scala
for (i <- 1.until(100).by(2)) do //This is the generator, the .until function provides a collection of range of numbers from 1 to 99 while the .by function indicates a step of 2
  println(i)
end for
```

```scala
for (i <- 1 until 100 by 2) do // We can also eliminate the. and () and write it one shot 
  println(i)
end for
```

```scala
//combination of generator, definition and filter in for loop
for (i <- 1 until 100 by 2 ; j <- 1 until 5 ; j2 = j + 1; k = i + j2 ; if k < 10) do //  j2 = j + 1; k = i + j2 is the definition, the if statement is the filter
  println(i)
end for
```
