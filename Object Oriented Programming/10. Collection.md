# 10. Collection

## Collection API
Three are three main categories of collections:

1. Sequences are a sequential collection of elements and may be indexed (like an array) or linear (like a linked list)
2. Maps (dictionary / associative array) contain a collection of key/value pairs, like a Java Map, Python dictionary, or Ruby Hash
3. Sets are an unordered collection of unique elements

**Scala Collecton Hirearchy**
- IndexedSeq = values in the collection can be accessed through index
- LinearSeq = values are accessed sequentially
- BitSet = values in the set can be accessed by flipping the bits

Immutable collecton, the values, size and type cannot be changed

Mutable collecton, the values, size and type cannot be changed

head = gets the first value
tail = produce a new sequence that consists of all elements except for the first element
apply = gets a value from the specific index
update = update the value at a specific index

## Array
Array is unique in the sense that the value can be changed but the size cannot be changed.

## List
- A list is an ordered collection of object
- list can contain duplicate values

If a method name ends with a colon, the operaton runs from right to left
