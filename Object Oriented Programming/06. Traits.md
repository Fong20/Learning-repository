# 06. Traits
- Also known as Interface in Java
- Traits allow mixin programming. In OOP, mixin is a class that contains methods for the usage of other classes without the need for inheritance
- Traits do not have constructor in Scala 2. However, traits support constructor in Scala 3
- Traits can be applied on both abstract class and concrete class
- Traits can be utilized by both the class or instance objects

## Scenario 1: Birds
There is no issue here since both the pigeon and hawk can fly and swim

When penguin is introduced, a new class called flying bird is created to implement the flying properties and methods. The pigeon class and hawk class can inherit the both flying and swimming properties / methods since they are all inherited. Penguin will only inherit properties / methods from the swimming class since it can only swim.

**Implementation of traits**

**Example: Usage of traits for class**

**Example: Usage of traits for instance objects using the with keyword**
- with keyword is used to apply the trait to only certain objects. This is good for scenarios where we want to apply a property / behavior only for certain objects of the class, not the overall class.
- In this case, Pigeons have the ability to fly but maybe some of the pigeon are injured which cannot fly. Hence, it is only applied to the pigeon instance object.
