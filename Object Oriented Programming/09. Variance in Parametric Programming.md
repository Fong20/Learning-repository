# 09. Variance in Parametric Programming

**Concepts**
- Variance annotation
- Variance Annotation Position
- Lower Bound, Upper Bound

## Varriance annotation (Relationship between generated types)
Since parametric class can generates many types. There are few methods to allow subtyping relationships among the generated type. There are following:
- nonvariant 
- covariant 
- contravariant 

### Nonvariant 
Type generated have no subtyping relationship. This is specified through [T]. 

**Example:**

Array collection is nonvariant

### Covariant
Covariant means the generated type will maintain the subtyping relationship based on the type parameter. This is specified through [+T]

**Example:**

Instance object of box cat, box dog, and box mouse is a subtype of box animal.

List collection is covariant

### Contravariant
- Type generated will have reverse subtyping relationship among each other. This is specified through [-T]
- Contravariant is used when generated types play the roles as consumer where the parent class is more flexible and powerful than the child class.

## Variance Annotation Postion
- The Scala compiler classifies all positions in a class or trait body as positive, negative, or neutral.
- A "position" is any location in the class (or trait, but from now on we'll just write "class") body where a type parameter may be used.
- Every method value parameter is a position, for example, because a method value parameter has a type, and therefore a type parameter could appear in that position. The compiler checks each use of each of the class's type parameters. Type parameters annotated with + may only be used in positive positions, while type parameters annotated with - may only be used in negative positions.
- A type parameter with no variance annotation may be used in any position, and is, therefore, the only kind of type parameter that can be used in neutral positions of the class body.

getter produces value, thus, the position of the type is positive

setter consumers value, thus, the position of the type is negative

## Upper Type Bound
- Basically sets a limit (constraint) to the type.

**Example:**

For example, an upper type bound T <: A declares that the type variable  T refers to subtypes of type A. In this case, if T is a subtype of type animal. This means T could only be animal, mouse, dog, cat or blackmouse

## Lower Type Bound
- While upper type bounds limit a type to a subtype of another type, the opposite is lower type bounds declare a type to be a supertype of another type. 
- The term B >: A expresses that the type parameter B or the abstract type B must refer to a supertype of type A. 

**Example:**

runme(Apple(“apple1”), Orange(”orange1”)) will return fruit, orange. It will automatically upcast the apple to fruit as A >: B states that it must be the supertype of B. In this case, the input is apple, where it inheritaned from fruit. Hence, A >: B will return fruit while B will return Orange.
