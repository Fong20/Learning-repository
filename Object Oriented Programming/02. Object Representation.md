# 02. Object Representation

## Class
- A class describes objects, as in Java or Scala.
- A class may extend one other class, and it may include any number of traits. A class has a primary constructor, which is part of the class declaration itself.
- Thus, class is known as the generalization of objects

### Types of classes
1. Abstract class
2. Concrete Class
3. Case Class

### Declare constructor class in Scala
The constructor class name must be the same as the project name

There are no properties here as there is no var/val keyword used

**Example: Class declaration of a Circle**

this() = this() is an auxillary constructor which must refer back to the primary constructor

## Object
- instance of a class
- Objects have a unique identity, state, and behavior
- State = an object which contains a set of properties with their current values

### Types of object
1. Singleton (objects created using the keyword object, only used to represent the real world object with a single characteristics )
2. Instance

### Singleton object
- Scala allows create of singleton object where the object is not created from Class but defined through object keyword.
- Singleton object is an object instance that exits with only one copy in the program.

### Companion object
- Companion object is singletone object that use to describe property  that apply to all instance of the object.
- A companion object is an object with the **same name as a class or trait** and is defined in the same source file as the associated file or trait.
- An analog to a companion object in Java is having a class with static methods. In Scala you would move the static methods to a Companion object.

## Property
- Known as the characteristics of the class
- When creating properties in Scala, it automatically comes with setter and getter

abstrct member = constructor parameter does not have any value
concrete member = constructor parameter have value

## Method
Known as the behavior of an object

## OOP Abstraction Levels 

### Level 0 :Objects
- used to access the methods in the class

### Level 1: Concrete Class
Is basically a template to represent the different types of real-world object.

### Level 2: Abstract Class
Group the
- reduces the repetition of the same characteristics
- simplifies change as we don't need to change the same information in different concrete class

### Level 3: Trait
- Further groups multiple abstract class which have similar characteristics to a single class
- known as maximum reusablity as this class can be used as long as it has the characteristc

## Important guidelines
- When creating a class for an object, you have to consider the did you needs multiple instance of that object in the programme. If you only needs 1 instance then should use singleton object instead of class
- When creating a property of a class you needs to decide to use val or var. You have to consider if the value would be change during the course of its live in the program.
- When creating a property of a class you needs to understand does the property is belong to instance object or the property is belong to all instance of that object. This is important so you know it should be in a class or companion object.
