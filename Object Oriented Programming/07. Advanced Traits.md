# 07. Advanced Traits

## Self type trait
- Self-types allow you to declare a trait that must be mixed into another trait. The trait does not need to directly extend another trait  and allow members of the dependency available without imports.
- Self-type trait is used when we specify that a trait must be implemented alongside another trait and they are not an inheritance relationship

this: AnimalID has the object of AnimalID. Thus, the retriver trait can use the object of AnimalID

## Multiple Inheritance
Scala does not support multiple inheritance but it supports multiple traits which emulates multiple inheritance. This means a class can only extend one parent class but it can extend more than one trait. However, this causes a diamond problem.

## Scala Trait Linerization
In determining which methods to invoke, Scala interpreter used a linearised graph which able to flatten the tree to single linear line. This process is called Linearisation .

**Linearization Rule:**
1. Start at the first extended class or trait and write that complete hierarchy down. This is call the linearized hierarchy
2. Take the next trait and write the trait hierarchy down
2.1 - Now remove all classes/traits from this hierarchy which are already in the linearized hierarchy
2.2  - Add the remaining traits to the bottom of the linearized hierarchy to create the new linearized hierarchy
3. Repeat step 2 for every trait.


**Example:**

Linearized Hierarchy:
- WhatsApp -> MobileApp -> Phone -> Message -> AnyRef -> Any 

Since whatsapp is the most front, it will start printing out its output first. Then, its super.message will call back to its hierarchical class which is MobileApp which will print out its output of app and call back its super.message. This process will repeat

Thus, println(d.message) would print out **whatsapp app phone message**
