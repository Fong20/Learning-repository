# 05. Polymorphism
- Is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts.
- allow the same operation/message to be carried out on different objects and perform differently

**Types of polymorphism**
- Static
- Dynamic

## Static Polymorphism
- Occurs at compilation time
- Implemented through Method overloading
- Method overloading occurs when there are two methods in same class which have the same method name but has different method signature (order, type, number of parameters)
- Method overloading does not involve parent class and subclass (extend relationship)

**Example:**

## Dynamic Polymorphism
- Occurs at runtime
- Implemented through method overriding
- Method overriding occurs when two methods in different class (super/sub class) have the same method name and same signature (order, type, number of parameters).
- It is used when an identical method in the subclass wants to perform different function from the parent class
- Method overriding only occurs in inheritance. Method overriding can be done by creating the same method which is found in the parent class in the sub class

## Type
A Type is a set of data values and the operations that can be performed on them.

In scala, thee are two ways to define new type
- class
- traits

### Define type from class
Any class C implicitly forms a type C. 
The set of public methods of the class form the set operations for type C 
The object of class C or its subclasses form the set of objects of that type.

### Scala Trait / Java Interface.
- Interface consist of a set of operations.
- All objects whose classes explicitly “implement” the interface form the set of object of that type.

## Subtype Polymorphism
Object of a subtype can be legally used wherever an object of a supertype is expected is called subtype polymorphism.

## Upcasting and Downcasting
- Known as the process of converting one type to another type (super type or subtype) .
- The process converting subtype to super type is upcasting. The opposite is down casting.
- In Scala, upcasting don’t require any additional syntax, but for downcasting, it is required to use the instance function

```scala
//Instance function must be used for downcasting
asInstanceOf[<supertype>]
```
