## Explicit Getter and Setter in Scala
There are two ways of create property in Scala, automated or explicit property creation. This chapter will cover the explicit property creation.

When declaring a property, there are three elements:
1. Private data field
2. Setter
3. Getter

### Setter
- Setter, also known as the accessor is used to access the values
- In scala, the setter can be generated automatically and manually.
- The setter is normally generated manually if we want to impose some sort of additional requirements or limitations
- If we generate manually, the name of the setter is in the form of mixed identifier, where it is the combination of property name and symbol

**Syntax:**

```scala
class Person(private var _name: String):
  //Create getter manually
  def name = _name

  //Create setter manually
  def name_ = (aName: String) = //method name is in the form of mixed identifier
    _name = aName
  end name_
end Person
```

## Constructor
- Constructor is an important construct used to create and initialize instance object.
- In scala, there is only one primary constructor.

### Types of constructor
1. Primary Constructor
2. Auxiliary Constructor
   
### Auxiliary constructor
Auxiliary constructor is an extention to the primary constructor
Whenever auxiliary constructor is executed, the primary constructor will be called

```scala
class Person(private var _name: String):
  def this("Fong") //Auxiliary constructor
```

## Case Class
Class usually is used to represent object in real world. But sometimes, we used class to represent value. 

There are some special characteristic when using object to represent value as the following:
- Object that used to represents value does not differentiate object that represents the same value.
- Object that represents values does not needs identity
- Object that represent value only focus on value that it representing.

### Important behavior of Case Class:
- Constructor parameters become public “fields” (Scala-style, which means that they really just have an associated accessor/mutator method pair)
- Methods toString(), equals() and hashCode() are defined based on the constructor fields
- A companion object containing:
  - An apply() constructor based on the class constructor
  - An extractor based on constructor fields



## Inheritance (Is a relationship)
- Inheritance is a technique in OOP to implements is a relationship between classes.
- In scala, we extend the parent class by extending the parent class name followed by its paramater list

#### Generalization and Specialization
- Are approaches of grouping object of similar type, we have two approaches. You can start with bottom up or top down approach.

#### Generalization
- Bottom up approach is the process of generalization. 

### Specialization
- Top down approach is the process of specialization. 

**Note: Specialization is generally better than generalization**

## Abstract class
- Abstract class is a class that contains unimplemented methods. Such methods are indicated with the keyword “abstract”.
- The methods is not implemented is due to there are no applicable action to carried out as a result of the class is too general.
- Abstract class is extensible by any classes.
- In UML, abstract methods are indicated by putting the methods name in italics.

In Scala, abstract class can have the following members:
- Abstract/Concrete property
- Abstract/Concrete behavior

var / val : variable nameabstract property
def makeSound(): Unit //Declare abstract method by putting Unit and not inserting any code block

**Example 1: Scala Inheritance using Specialization (Top down approach)**

temporary variable can be created by putting _ followed by the variable name

## Association
- Defined as the relationship between objects

### Aggregation (Weak has a relationship)
- Association where the objects have their own life cycles
- An essential property of an aggregation relationship is that the whole or parent (i.e. the owner) obejct can exist without the part or child and vice versa.

### Composition (Strong has a relationship)
- An essential property of an composition relationship is that the whole child object cease to exist when the parent object is destroyed vice versa.
- The child object is implemented inside the parent constructor body. When the parent object is created, the child object will be run internally.
