## Explicit Getter and Setter in Scala
There are two ways of create property in Scala, automated or explicit property creation. This chapter will cover the explicit property creation. 

When declaring a property, there are three elements:
1. Private data field
2. Setter
3. Getter

### Setter
- Setter, also known as the accessor is used to access the values
- In scala, the setter can be generated automatically and manually.
- The setter is normally generated manually if we want to impose some sort of additional requirements or limitations
- If we generate manually, the name of the setter is in the form of mixed identifier, where it is the combination of property name and symbol

**Syntax:**

```scala
class Person(private var _name: String):
  //Create getter manually
  def name = _name

  //Create setter manually
  def name_ = (aName: String) = //method name is in the form of mixed identifier
    _name = aName
  end name_
end Person
```
