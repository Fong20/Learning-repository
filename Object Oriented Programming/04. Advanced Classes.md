## Explicit Getter and Setter in Scala
There are two ways of create property in Scala, automated or explicit property creation. This chapter will cover the explicit property creation.

When declaring a property, there are three elements:
1. Private data field
2. Setter
3. Getter

### Setter
- Setter, also known as the accessor is used to access the values
- In scala, the setter can be generated automatically and manually.
- The setter is normally generated manually if we want to impose some sort of additional requirements or limitations
- If we generate manually, the name of the setter is in the form of mixed identifier, where it is the combination of property name and symbol

**Syntax:**

```scala
class Person(private var _name: String):
  //Create getter manually
  def name = _name

  //Create setter manually
  def name_ = (aName: String) = //method name is in the form of mixed identifier
    _name = aName
  end name_
end Person
```

## Constructor
- Constructor is an important construct used to create and initialize instance object.
- In scala, there is only one primary constructor.

### Types of constructor
1. Primary Constructor
2. Auxiliary Constructor
   
### Auxiliary constructor
Auxiliary constructor is an extention to the primary constructor
Whenever auxiliary constructor is executed, the primary constructor will be called

```scala
class Person(private var _name: String):
  def this("Fong") //Auxiliary constructor
```

## Case Class
Class usually is used to represent object in real world. But sometimes, we used class to represent value. 

There are some special characteristic when using object to represent value as the following:
- Object that used to represents value does not differentiate object that represents the same value.
- Object that represents values does not needs identity
- Object that represent value only focus on value that it representing.

### Important behavior of Case Class:
- Constructor parameters become public “fields” (Scala-style, which means that they really just have an associated accessor/mutator method pair)
- Methods toString(), equals() and hashCode() are defined based on the constructor fields
- A companion object containing:
  - An apply() constructor based on the class constructor
  - An extractor based on constructor fields
