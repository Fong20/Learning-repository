# 01. Introduction 

## Data types in Scala
Scala programming language come with few class to represents values type which are shown below:
- double
- float
- long
- int
- short
- byte
- unit
- boolean
- char

all these are subclasses of the anyval superclass

## Operator in Scala
- Arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /, %)
- Logical Operator
- Relational Operator
- Assignment Operator (=)
- Bitwise Operator

## Variables in Scala
- Scala has the different syntax for the declaration of variables and they can be defined as value, i.e., constant or a variable
- val = constant variable
- var = mutable variable

### Syntax: Declaring constant variable

```
val variable_name: data type = value
```

**Example:**

```
val myVal :String;
```

### Syntax: Declaring mutable variable

```
var variable_name: data type = value
```

**Example:**

```
var myVar :Int;
```

### Variable type inference
However, there is no need to always specify variable type. Scala compiler can figure out the type of the variable based on the value assigned to the variable. 

**Example**

```
var myVar = 10;
```

```
val myVal = "Hello, Scala!";
```

### Field variable scope
Fields are variables that belong to an object. The fields are accessible from inside every method in the object. Fields can also be accessible outside the object depending on what access modifiers the field is declared with. Object fields can be both mutable or immutable types and can be defined using either var or val.

### Variables as method parameters
Method parameters are variables, which are used to pass the value inside a method when the method is called. Method parameters are only accessible from inside the method but the objects passed in may be accessible from the outside, if you have a reference to the object from outside the method. Method parameters are always immutable and defined by val keyword.

## Functions in Scala
- There are 2 types of function in Scala, Pre-Defined Functions and User defined Functions.
- Scala permits nested function
- Scala function's name can have characters like +, ++, ~, &,-, -- , \, /, : etc
  
### Pre-defined functions
- Pre-Defined functions are functions that are already created in the language library or third-party library. You are required to read the functions API documentation and uses the functions.
- Eg: Input and output function

**Syntax for printing output**
- print()
- println()

**Syntax for retreiving input from keyboard**

```
scala.io.StdIn.readline()
```

### User-defined functions
User defined functions are functions that is crated by user for specialize task which is not available in the language's third-party library.

**Syntax to declare a user-defined function**

```
def function_name(parameter: datatype, parameter: datatype): return type =
  
  function body
  
  return

end function_name
```

Note: the end statement is optional, it is just used to determine the end of the function

If the function does not return anything, it can return unit which is equivalent to void in Java

```
def function_name(parameter: datatype, parameter: datatype): Unit =
  
  function body
  
end function_name
```

**Example: Nested functions**

## Statements and Expressions

### Statements
- A statement expresses some action to be carried out in sequence and is made up of several internal components which are known as expressions.
- A compound statement is a statement that consists of several lines

### Expressions
- Expression is a value, or anything that executes and ends up being a value.
- ExpressionsÂ are made up of small components such as (operand, operator, value).
- Expressions must be dealt with the correct order, also known as the order of operations

**Example:**

5 + 4

- 5 and 4 is known as the operand
- + is known as the operator




### Separating statements in Scala
Statements are separated in Scala by either inserting a new line or using a semicolon

## Classes in Scala

### Case class
- If we are describing a value, we need to use case class
- There is no need to write val as case class is already specifying that the attributes are constant

**Syntax:**

```
case class(attribute_name: datatype, attribute_name: datatype)
```
### Class
If we are describing an object's state, use class

**Syntax:**

```
class(var attribute_name: datatype, attribute_name: datatype)
```
