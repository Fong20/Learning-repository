# 01. Introduction 

## Data types in Scala
- double
- float
- long
- int
- short
- byte
- unit
- boolean
- char

all these are subclasses of the anyval superclass

## Operator in Scala
- Arithmetic operator
- Logical Operator
- Relational Operator
- Assignment Operator
- Bitwise Operator

## Variables in Scala
- Scala has the different syntax for the declaration of variables and they can be defined as value, i.e., constant or a variable
- val = constant variable
- var = mutable variable

### Syntax: Declaring constant variable
- val variable_name: data type = value
- Eg: val myVal :String;

### Syntax: Declaring mutable variable
- var variable_name: data type = value
- Eg:  var myVar :Int;

### Variable type inference
However, there is no need to always specify variable type. When you assign an initial value to a variable, the Scala compiler can figure out the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it. 

Example
- var myVar = 10;
- val myVal = "Hello, Scala!";

### Field variable scope
Fields are variables that belong to an object. The fields are accessible from inside every method in the object. Fields can also be accessible outside the object depending on what access modifiers the field is declared with. Object fields can be both mutable or immutable types and can be defined using either var or val.

### Variables as method parameters
Method parameters are variables, which are used to pass the value inside a method when the method is called. Method parameters are only accessible from inside the method but the objects passed in may be accessible from the outside, if you have a reference to the object from outside the method. Method parameters are always immutable and defined by val keyword.
