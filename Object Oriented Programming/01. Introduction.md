# 01. Introduction 

## Data types in Scala
- double
- float
- long
- int
- short
- byte
- unit
- boolean
- char

all these are subclasses of the anyval superclass

## Operator in Scala
- Arithmetic operator
- Logical Operator
- Relational Operator
- Assignment Operator
- Bitwise Operator

## Variables in Scala
- Scala has the different syntax for the declaration of variables and they can be defined as value, i.e., constant or a variable
- val = constant variable
- var = mutable variable

### Syntax: Declaring constant variable
- val variable_name: data type = value
- Eg: val myVal :String;

### Syntax: Declaring mutable variable
- var variable_name: data type = value
- Eg:  var myVar :Int;

### Variable type inference
However, there is no need to always specify variable type. When you assign an initial value to a variable, the Scala compiler can figure out the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it. 

**Example**
- var myVar = 10;
- val myVal = "Hello, Scala!";

### Field variable scope
Fields are variables that belong to an object. The fields are accessible from inside every method in the object. Fields can also be accessible outside the object depending on what access modifiers the field is declared with. Object fields can be both mutable or immutable types and can be defined using either var or val.

### Variables as method parameters
Method parameters are variables, which are used to pass the value inside a method when the method is called. Method parameters are only accessible from inside the method but the objects passed in may be accessible from the outside, if you have a reference to the object from outside the method. Method parameters are always immutable and defined by val keyword.

## Functions in Scala
- There are 2 types of function. Pre-Defined Functions and User defined Functions.
- Scala function's name can have characters like +, ++, ~, &,-, -- , \, /, : etc
  
### Pre-defined functions
- Pre-Defined functions are functions that are already created in the language library or third-party library. You are required to read the functions API documentation and uses the functions.
- Eg: Input and output function

**Syntax for printing output**
- print()
- println()

**Syntax for retreiving input from keyboard**

scala.io.StdIn.readline()


### User-defined functions
User defined functions are functions that is crated by user for specialize task which is not available in language or third-party library.

**Syntax to declare a user-defined function**

def function_name(parameter: datatype, parameter: datatype): return type =
  function body
  return
end function_name

If the function does not return anything, it can return unit which is equivalent to void in Java
Note: the end statement is optional

## Separating statements in Scala
We can separate statements in Scala by either inserting a new line or using a semicolon


## Creating a class
If we are describing a value, we need to use case class

**Syntax:**

case class(attribute_name: datatype, attribute_name: datatype)

If we are describing an object's state, use class

**Syntax:**

class(var attribute_name: datatype, attribute_name: datatype)
