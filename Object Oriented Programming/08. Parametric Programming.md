# 08. Parametric Programming
- Parametric enable types (classes and trait) to be parameters when defining classes, trait and methods. Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations,
- Parametric Programming is a programming style which write algorithm in term of to-be-specified-later type.
- Parametric Programming allows an algorithm that are capable of operating on a wide range of data structures, to be implemented in the same implementation by finding commonalities.
- Known as Generic Programming in Java
- Basically, it allows classes, traits to receive parameters and these parameters are not values, but instead is a type. The type could be another class or general data types such as int

The following image showcases parametric programming where the box class can be implemented with apple class, cat class, and shirt class

## Type Parameter Naming Convention
Type parameter can be represented by any alphabets

## Parametric Class
Similar to a class which can receive multiple parameters, a class can also receive multiple type 


```scala
val p5 = newOrderPair("Even",8) // Compiler will use the type parameters to identify the type
val p6 = new OrderPair("hello","world")

```

## Erasure in Parametric programming
Compiler translates the generic methods printArray into Java bytecoes, it removes the type parameter section and replaces the type parameters with actual types. This process is known as erasure. 

**Example:**
- By default all generic types are replaced with type Object.
- So the compiled version of method printArray is:

```scala
def printArray(arr: Array[Object]): Unit =
  for (item <- arr)
    println(s"$item")
  
  println()
```
