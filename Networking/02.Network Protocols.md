# Network Protocols
- Network Protocols are rules or protocols that all nodes on a network must follow for information transfer.
- Network Protocols are standardized meaning all nodes follow the same rules regardless of the manufacturer
- Common protocols include the TCP/IP suite, IEEE 802, Ethernet, WLAN and cellular standards.
  
In order to transfer resources through a network:

- Source = source of the data sent from the sender
- encoder = Convert the data into binary form
- transmitter = transmits the data through the network
- receiver = receives the data 
- Decoder = Decode the data from binary form into the exact format
- destination = destination source of the recipient

  the source and destination is usually represented by the IP address.
