# Network Protocols

## 2.1 Rules of  communication
  ### Message Encoding
  In order to transfer resources through a network:

- **Source** = source of the data sent from the sender
- **encoder** = Convert the data into binary form
- **transmitter** = transmits the data through the network
- **receiver** = receives the data 
- **Decoder** = Decode the data from binary form into the exact format
- **destination** = destination source of the recipient

  Note: the source and destination is usually represented by the IP address.

  ### Message Size
  - There is a limitation in transfering huge data over the network. (Eg: bandwidth of network)
  - Therefore, the data is split into smaller packets (segmentation). Each packet is encapsulated in a separate frame with the address         information (IP address) and sent over the network.
  - At the receiving host, the packet is de-encapsulated and put back together to be processed and interpreted.

  ### Message Timing
  Rules which manages the time difference of the reception of packets
 
  ### Message Delivery Options
  Refers to how the message is delivered
  
  **Types of message delivery options**
  - **Unicast** = data is sent to only one user
  - **Multicast** = data is sent to more than one user (2 to 4 users)
  - **Broadcast** = data is sent to all users in the network.

  ## 2.2 Network protocols and standards

  ### What are network protocols?
  - Network Protocols are rules or protocols that all nodes on a network must follow for information transfer. It               determines how data is transmitted betweeen different devices in the network.
    
  - Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make      it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devicesâ€™ software and         hardware. Neither local area networks (LAN) nor wide area networks (WAN) could function the way they do today without       the use of network protocols.
    
  - It also takes into account of error handling (how and when error and system messages are passed between devices)
   
  - Network Protocols are standardized meaning all nodes follow the same rules regardless of the manufacturer.
    
  - Common protocols include the TCP/IP suite, IEEE 802, Ethernet, WLAN and cellular standards.
 
    ### Who creates the Network Protocols?
    Network protocols are typically created according to industry standard by various networking or information technology      organizations such as:

    - The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
    - The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    - The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
    - The Internet Society (ISOC)
    - tHE International Architecture Board (IAB)
    - The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
    - The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
    
    While network protocol models generally work in similar ways, each protocol is unique and operates in the specific way      detailed by the organization that created it.
    
    ### Protocol stack/ Protocol suite
    The term protocol suite refers to a set of smaller network protocols stacked together working in conjunction with each      other.

    ### Types of protocol suite
    - TCP/IP suite
    - ISO
    - AppleTalk
    - Novell Netware

    ### Layers of a protocol suite
   Network protocols take large-scale processes and break them down into small, specific tasks or functions. This occurs at    every level of the network, and each function must cooperate at each level to complete the larger task at hand. 
    
    - Application layer (interface between the user and the device)
    - Transport layer
    - Internet layer
    - Network Access layer
      
  We follow from upper layer to lower layer.

    ### TCP/IP suite
    TCP/IP suite is one of the most commonly used protocol suite. It is a protocol stack as it consists of multiple             protocols stack together (Application protocol, transfer protocol, internet protocol and network access protocol)

    TCP/IP suite consists of **four layers** which are:

    1. **Network access layer.** This layer defines how the data is physically transferred through the network, as well as         how hardware devices send bits through a network medium, such as coaxial, optical, fiber or twisted-pair cables.
    
    2. **Internet layer.** **This is the layer where routing takes place.** It **packages data into packets and enables them to          be sent and received over the network.** The internet layer includes IP, Address Resolution Protocol and Internet             Control Message Protocol.
       
    3. **Transport layer.** This layer **ensures the stable, sequenced and error-free delivery of data packets.** It achieves          this by swapping acknowledgment of data reception and retransmitting lost or dropped packets. Typical protocols             used at the transport layer include TCP and User Datagram Protocol.
      
    4. **Application layer.** Security protocols, such as Transport Layer Security, operate at this layer and play an              integral part in ensuring network security. This is the abstraction layer that communicates directly with                   applications and defines how high-level apps should access the network to start a data transfer. For example, the           application layer is used to define where, when and how much data should be sent at a specific rate.

    ### OSI
    The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** model was developed by ISO which is another type of protocol stack. The OSI model contains 7 layers which are:
  
    1. Physical layer
    2. Data link layer
    3. Network layer
    4. Transport layer
    5. Session layer
    6. Presentation layer
    7. Application layer (interface between the user and the device)

  Note: There are actually only 5 layers which are the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer nad application layer used in real world networking. However, they did not change it so it still remains as 7 layers.

  ### TCP/IP vs OSI
  
  Note:
  - The physical layer and data link layer is similar to the network access layer in TCP/IP suite.
  - The network layer is similar to the internet layer in the TCP/IP suite.
  - The transport layer is similar to the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite.
  - The session layer, presentation layer and application layer is similar to the application layer in the TCP/IP suite.

  ## 2.3 Moving data in the network

  ### Protocol data unit (PDU)

  Protocol data units are units used to describe the data while in different layers.

  Header is the additional data which is added to ensure that the data is sent correctly to the destination

  **Units according to each layer**
  - In **application layer**, it is known as **data**.
  - In **transport layer**, the data is known as a **segment.**
  - In **network layer**, the data is known as a **packet.**
  - In the **data link layer**, the data is known as **frame**
  - In the **physical layer**, the data is known as **bits**.

  What the units mean?
  - segment = transport header + data
  - packet = network header + transport header + data
  - frame = frame header + network header + transport header + data

  **Address of a data**
  destination MAC address, source MAC address + source IP address, destination IP address.

  ### Switch vs Router
  - A **switch is used to connect devices in the same LAN** while a **router is used to connect multiple LANs together.**
  - A **switch is a second layer device (data link layer)** whereas a **router is a third layer device (network layer).**
  - Swutch finds a device based on the MAC address while the router finds a device based on the IP address.

  ### MAC address vs IP address
  MAC address is used in the switch in the second layer whereas the IP address is used in the router in the third layer.

  ### Gateway
  Gateway is the first router that connects a LAN to other networks.
