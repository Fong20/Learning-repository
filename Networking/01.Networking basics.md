# Networking basics
A computer network is a **group of interconnected nodes or computing devices that exchange data and resources with each other.**

## Size of networks
- Small home networks
- Small offices/Home offices (SOHO)
- Medium to Large networks
- World wide network

## Types of network
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Storage Area Network (SAN)

## Components of a network

### Devices (Node)
- Devices which are connected to the network
- Eg: Smartphone, PC, router etc...

**Important devices:**
- switch = connects the devices in a LAN
- router = connects multiple LANS together

### Media
- Medium/Link which connects the devices to the network.
- It could be wired or wireless.
- Types of cable (Eg: twisted copper cable, fiber optic..)

### Services
- The service which are provided to the end user.

## Network architecture
Network architecture is the overall design of a computer network that describes how a computer network is configured


## Client and server
- Consists of many clients (nodes) and  at least one of the nodes is the server.
- The clients don't share resources, but request it from the central server, as all the resources are installed on it.
- Can be used for small to large networks.

**Advantages**
- Scalable

**Disadvantages**
- More complex
- More costly to setup due to its increase in number of devices.
- Server may get bottlenecked as all services are provided by a centralized server, thus slow down the system efficiency.


## Peer to peer
- Each nodes on the network functions similar to a client and server. Each and every node can both request and respond for the services.  
- Each node is considered a peer.
- Generally used for small networks.

**Advantages**
- Less costly to operate

**Disadvantages**
- Security. It is challenging to give nodes in peer-to-peer networks proper security because they function as both clients and servers. A denial of service attack may result from this.
- Less scalable.

## Converged networks
- Each network is designed to provide a particular service (Eg: telephone network to make calls, broadcasting network to broadcast services etc)
- Converged network provides multiple services in a single network.

## 4 key characteristics of creating a reliable network architecture

### Fault tolerance
- The operation of a network is not errorproof . Therefore, Fault tolerance must be taken into account to rectify the issue.
-  Eg: data transfer error

### Scalability
- The network must be scalable 

### Quality of Service
- Is the 

### Security
- The network must be secure from any cyberthreats

## Switching methods

### Circuit switching

Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit, is established between two devices before data transmission begins.

Advantages
- **Guaranteed bandwidth:** Circuit switching provides a dedicated path for communication, ensuring that bandwidth is guaranteed for the duration of the call.
- **Low latency:** Circuit switching provides low latency because the path is predetermined, and there is no need to establish a connection for each packet.
- **Predictable performance:** Circuit switching provides predictable performance because the bandwidth is reserved, and there is no competition for resources.
- **Suitable for real-time communication:** Circuit switching is suitable for real-time communication, such as voice and video, because it provides low latency and predictable performance.

**Disadvantages**
- **Inefficient use of bandwidth:** Circuit switching is inefficient because the bandwidth is reserved for the entire duration of the call, even when no data is being transmitted.
- **Limited scalability: **Circuit switching is limited in its scalability because the number of circuits that can be established is finite, which can limit the number of simultaneous calls that can be made.
- **High cost:** Circuit switching is expensive because it requires dedicated resources, such as hardware and bandwidth, for the duration of the call.
  
### Packet switching*

Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network. Each packet contains the source and destination address and other information which is needed for routing.

**Advantages:**
-** Efficient use of bandwidth:** Packet switching is efficient because bandwidth is shared among multiple users, and resources are allocated only when data needs to be transmitted.
- **Flexible:** Packet switching is flexible and can handle a wide range of data rates and packet sizes.
- **Scalable:** Packet switching is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of traffic on a network.
- **Lower cost:** Packet switching is less expensive than circuit switching because resources are shared among multiple users.

**Disadvantages**
- **Higher latency:** Packet switching has higher latency than circuit switching because packets must be routed through multiple nodes, which can cause delay.
- **Limited QoS:** Packet switching provides limited QoS guarantees, meaning that different types of traffic may be treated equally.
- **Packet loss:** Packet switching can result in packet loss due to congestion on the network or errors in transmission.
- **Unsuitable for real-time communication:** Packet switching is not suitable for real-time communication, such as voice and video, because of the potential for latency and packet loss.

### Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- It is a company which provides consumers access to the internet.
- It works based on hierachy (Local ISP to Tier-2 ISP to Tier-1 ISP)
