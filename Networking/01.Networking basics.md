# Networking basics
A computer network is a **group of interconnected nodes or computing devices that exchange data and resources with each other.**

## Size of networks
- Small home networks
- Small offices/Home offices (SOHO)
- Medium to Large networks
- World wide network

## Types of network
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Storage Area Network (SAN)

## Components of a network

### Devices (Node)
- Devices which are connected to the network
- Eg: Smartphone, PC, router etc...

**Important devices:**
- switch = connects the devices in a LAN
- router = connects multiple LANS together

### Media
- Medium/Link which connects the devices to the network.
- It could be pyhsical through cables or wireless.
- Types of cable (Eg: twisted copper cable, fiber optic..)

### Services
- The service which are provided to the end user.

## Network architecture
Network architecture is the overall design of a computer network that describes how a computer network is configured


## Client and server
- Consists of many clients (nodes) and  at least one of the nodes is the server.
- The clients don't share resources, but request it from the central server, as all the resources are installed on it.
- Can be used for small to large networks.

**Advantages**
- Scalable

**Disadvantages**
- More complex
- More costly to setup due to its increase in number of devices.
- Server may get bottlenecked as all services are provided by a centralized server, thus slow down the system efficiency.


## Peer to peer
- Each nodes on the network functions similar to a client and server. Each and every node can both request and respond for the services.  
- Each node is considered a peer.
- Generally used for small networks.

**Advantages**
- Less costly to operate

**Disadvantages**
- Security. It is challenging to give nodes in peer-to-peer networks proper security because they function as both clients and servers. A denial of service attack may result from this.
- Less scalable.
