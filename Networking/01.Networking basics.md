# Networking basics

## 1.1 Fundamentals 
### What is a computer network?
A computer network is a **group of interconnected nodes or computing devices that exchange data and resources with each other.**

### Size of networks
- Small home networks
- Small offices/Home offices (SOHO)
- Medium to Large networks
- World wide network

### Types of network
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Storage Area Network (SAN)

### Components of a network

 **Devices (Node)**
- Devices which are connected to the network
- Eg: Smartphone, PC, router etc...

**Important devices:**
- switch = connects the devices in a LAN
- router = connects multiple LANS together

**Media**
- Medium/Link which signals are transmitted.
- It could be wired or wireless.
- Types of cable (Eg: twisted copper cable, fiber optic..)

**Services**
- The service which are provided to the end user.

## The internet
Internet is a network of networks. 

## 1.2 Network architecture
Network architecture is the overall design of a computer network that describes how a computer network is configured.


### Client and server
- Consists of many clients (nodes) and  at least one of the nodes is the server.
- The clients don't share resources, but request resources from the central server, as all the resources are installed on it while the server provides the resources to the client.
- Can be used for small to large networks.

**Advantages**
- Scalable

**Disadvantages**
- More complex
- More costly to setup due to its increase in number of devices.
- Server may get bottlenecked as all services are provided by a centralized server, thus slow down the system efficiency.


### Peer to peer
- **Each nodes on the network functions similar to a client and server. ****Each and every node can both request and respond for the services. ** 
- Each **node is considered a peer.**
- Generally **used for small networks.**

**Advantages**
- Less costly to operate

**Disadvantages**
- Security. It is challenging to give nodes in peer-to-peer networks proper security because they function as both clients and servers. A denial of service attack may result from this.
- Less scalable.

### 4 key characteristics of creating a reliable network architecture

### 1. Fault tolerance
- The operation of a network is not errorproof . Therefore, Fault tolerance must be taken into account to rectify the issue.
-  Eg: data transfer error

### 2. Scalability
- The network must be scalable 

### 3. Quality of Service
The quality of service of a network can be analyzed from many different aspects such as the latency, data rate and even the security of the network.

  **Latency**

  Defined as the delay of transmission of data between two points of the network.

   **Data rate**
   
   Data Rate is defined as **the amount of data transmitted during a specified time period over a network.** It is the **speed at which data is transferred from one device to another or between a peripheral device and the computer.**
   
  **Time-sensitive vs non-time sensitive communication**
- The priority of services offered by the network depends on the use case. If it is time-sensitive communication such as telephony or video distribution, the priority for such services is increased.
- As for non-time sensitive communication such as web page retrieval or email, the priority is decreased.

  **Bandwidth**
  
  Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically **measured in the number of bits** that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second.

  **Throughput**

   Throughput measures the amount of data that can flow across the media over a given period of time including any delays which occur.

  Many factors influence throughput including:
  - The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
  - The types of data being transmitted
  - The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
  

### 4. Security
- The network must be secure from any cyberthreats to avoid data theft.

## 1.3 Converged networks
- Each network is designed to provide a particular service (Eg: telephone network to make calls, broadcasting network to broadcast services etc)
- Converged network provides multiple services in a single network.

## 1.4 Switching methods

### Circuit switching

Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit, is established between two devices before data transmission begins.

**Advantages**
- **Guaranteed bandwidth:** Circuit switching provides a dedicated path for communication, ensuring that bandwidth is guaranteed for the duration of the call.
- **Low latency:** Circuit switching provides low latency because the path is predetermined, and there is no need to establish a connection for each packet.
- **Predictable performance:** Circuit switching provides predictable performance because the bandwidth is reserved, and there is no competition for resources.
- **Suitable for real-time communication:** Circuit switching is suitable for real-time communication, such as voice and video, because it provides low latency and predictable performance.

**Disadvantages**
- **Inefficient use of bandwidth:** Circuit switching is inefficient because the bandwidth is reserved for the entire duration of the call, even when no data is being transmitted.
- **Limited scalability:** Circuit switching is limited in its scalability because the number of circuits that can be established is finite, which can limit the number of simultaneous calls that can be made.
- **High cost:** Circuit switching is expensive because it requires dedicated resources, such as hardware and bandwidth, for the duration of the call.
  
### Packet switching

Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network. Each packet contains the source and destination address and other information which is needed for routing.

**Advantages:**
-** Efficient use of bandwidth:** Packet switching is efficient because bandwidth is shared among multiple users, and resources are allocated only when data needs to be transmitted.
- **Flexible:** Packet switching is flexible and can handle a wide range of data rates and packet sizes.
- **Scalable:** Packet switching is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of traffic on a network.
- **Lower cost:** Packet switching is less expensive than circuit switching because resources are shared among multiple users.

**Disadvantages**
- **Higher latency:** Packet switching has higher latency than circuit switching because packets must be routed through multiple nodes, which can cause delay.
- **Limited QoS:** Packet switching provides limited QoS guarantees, meaning that different types of traffic may be treated equally.
- **Packet loss:** Packet switching can result in packet loss due to congestion on the network or errors in transmission.
- **Unsuitable for real-time communication:** Packet switching is not suitable for real-time communication, such as voice and video, because of the potential for latency and packet loss.

### 1.5 Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- It is a company which provides consumers access to the internet. It links the home network to the internet.
- An ISP can be the **local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service,** or an** independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.**
- It works based on hierachy to enesure that internet traffic takes the shortest path from the source to the destination (Local ISP to Tier-2 ISP to Tier-1 ISP)

  ### ISP Connectivity Options
  - cable
  - Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
  - Cellular
  - Satellite
  - Dial-up telephone

**Cellular and Satellite connections** are **ideal for areas that would not have internet connectivity.**

Among all ISP connectivity options, **dial-up phone has the lowest bandwidth.**
  

 **Cable**
  - Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television.
  -  It provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. A special cable modem separates the internet data signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.

  **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)**
  - DSL provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed modem that **separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal** and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.
  - DSL runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels. One channel used for voice telephone calls, second channel for download and third channel for seding or uploading information.
  - The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company
