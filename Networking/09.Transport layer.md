# 09 Transport Layer
- Transport layer protocols specify how to transfer messages between hosts, and are responsible for managing reliability requirements of a conversation.
- There are **two main types of transport layer protocol** which are **Transission control protocol (TCP)** and **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**

## Responsibilities of transport layer
- Tracking Individual Conversations
- Segmenting Data and Reassembling Segments. The transport layer divides the data into smaller blocks (i.e., segments or datagrams) that are easier to manage and transport.
- Add Header Information. The transport layer protocol also adds header information containing binary data organized into several fields to each block of data.
- Identifying the applications. To pass data streams to the proper applications, the transport layer identifies the target application using an identifier called a port number. 
- Conversation Multiplexing. Sending some different types of data (e.g., a streaming video) across a network, as one complete communication stream, can consume all the available bandwidth. This would prevent other communication conversations from occurring at the same time. The transport layer **uses segmentation and multiplexing** to enable different communication conversations to be conducted on the same network.

## Port numbers
- **TCP and UDP transport layer protocols use port numbers to manage multiple, simultaneous conversations.**
- The **source port number is associated with the originating application on the local host** whereas the **destination port number is associated with the destination application on the remote host.**
-**Each request generated by a host will use a different dynamically created source port number. This process allows multiple conversations to occur simultaneously.**
- The destination port number is what **identifies the type of service being requested of the destination web server.**
- In otherwards, a host is able to perform multiple separate communications simultaneously using different port numbers.

### Port number groups
The 16 bits port numbers are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The IANA has divided the range of numbers into the following three port groups.

## Socket and socket pairs
- A socket is known as the **combination of source IP address and the source port number** or **destination IP address and destination port number.**
- Sockets enable** multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other**, and **multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.**
- A **socket pair is the combination of source socket and destination socket.**
Eg: 
- The client socket is 192.168.1.5:1099
- the socket on the web server is 192.168.1.7:80
- The socket pair is 192.168.1.5:1099, 192.168.1.7:80

## Types of transport layer protocol
The transport layer includes two protocols:
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) = reliable, flow and congestion controlled but requires more processing power and contains more delay.
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) = connectionless and based on best effort.

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Unlike IP which only focuses on structuring, addressing and routing packets from source to destination, TCP is considered a **reliable, connection-oriented and full-featured transport layer protocol, which ensures that all of the data arrives at the destination.** TCP includes fields which ensure the delivery of the application data. These fields require additional processing by the sending and receiving hosts. 
- TCP divides data into segments
- TCP is **used in applications where it is important that all the data arrives and that it can be processed in its proper sequence such as databases, web browsers, and email clients. Any missing data could corrupt a communication, making it either incomplete or unreadable.**
- **netstat** command is used to check TCP connections which are open and running on a networked host.

TCP provides reliability and flow control using these basic operations:
- Number and track data segments transmitted to a specific host from a specific application
- Acknowledge received data
- Retransmit any unacknowledged data after a certain amount of time
- Sequence data that might arrive in wrong order
- Send data at an efficient rate that is acceptable by the receiver

  ### TCP header
  - A TCP segment **adds 20 bytes (i.e., 160 bits) of overhead when encapsulating the application layer data.**
  - The TCP header is a **20-byte header with 10 fields.**
  
 **10 fields of the TCP header:**
 - source port = identify the source application by port number
 - destination port = idnetify the destination application by port number
 - sequence number = used for data reassembly process
 - acknowledgement number = used to indicate that data has been received and the next byte expected from the source.
 - header length = length of the TCP segment header
 - reserved = field that is reserved for future use
 - control bits = includes codes or flags which indicate the purpose and function of TCP segment
 - window size = indicate the number of bytes that can be accepted at one time
 - checksum = used for error checking of the TCP's segment header and data
 - urgent = used to indicate that the contained data is urgent

  ### Applications which use TCP
  - HTTP/HTTPS (Web services)
  - FTP (File transfer services)
  - SMTP (Email services)
  - IMAP (Email services)
  - SSH

### TCP communication process
Generally, TCP communication process functions through the three way handshake.

  ### TCP Server process
  - Each application process running on a server is configured using a port number.
- A server cannot have identical port number assigned to different services (Eg: email service and web service have different port numbers)
  - An active server assigned to a specific port is considered open, which menas that the transport layer accepts and processes segments addressed to that port. Any incoming client request which is addressed to the correct socket is accepted and passed to the server application.

  ### TCP connection establishment process. 
  Step 1: The initiating client requests a client to-server communication session (SYN) with the server.
  
  Step 2: The server sends back an acknowledgement reply known as ACK, requesting a server to client communication.
  
  STEP 3: The initiating client acknowledges the server-to-client communication session.

  ### TCP Session termination
  Session termination is performed when there is no more data to be sent by the client.
  
  Step 1: The client sends a segment with a FIN flag set to the server

  Step 2: The server sends back an ACK to acknowledge that it has received the FIN to terminate the session from client to server.

  Step 3: The server sends a FIN to the client to terminate the server to client session.

  Step 4: The client responds with an ACK to acknowledge the FIN from the server.

### TCP reliability and flow control

  ### TCP Relaibility - Guranteed and ordered delivery of segments
  There may be times when TCP segments do not arrive or arrive out of order at their destination. The sequence number allows datagram/segment to be reassembled in the correct order.

### TCP Reliability - data loss and retransmission

### TCP Flow control
Flow control is **defined as the amount of data that the destination can receive and process reliably.**

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/096b566c-3479-4e7d-a789-a955d7f49cf1)

### TCP Flow control - maximum segment size
- Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is the **maximum amount of data that the destination device can receive.**
- A common MSS is 1,460 bytes when using IPv4. This is calculated by removing the IP and TCP headers from the ethernet maximum transmission unit (MTU) which is 1500 bytes by default. 1500 minus 60 (20 bytes for the 
IPv4 header and 20 bytes for the TCP header) leaves 1460 bytes.

### TCP Flow control - Congestion avoidance

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- UDP is a simpler transport layer protocol than TCP. It **does not provide reliability and flow control**, which means it requires fewer header fields.
- Because the sender and the receiver UDP processes do not have to manage reliability and flow control, this means UDP datagrams can be processed faster than TCP segments.
- UDP also divides data into datagrams (segments)
- UDP is preferable for applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP), live video which requires minimal latency.  Live video and voice applications can tolerate some data loss with minimal or no noticeable effect, and are perfectly suited to UDP.
- UDP is also **used by request-and-reply applications where the data is minimal, and retransmission can be done quickly such as DNS.**
- UDP is also used in applications which are able to handle reliability themselves such as SNMP and TFTP.

  UDP has few characteristics which are identical to IP:
- It is connectionless protocol (stateless protocol). Because UDP does not provide reliability or flow control, it does not require an established connection. It also means it does not send back an acknowledgement to tell the source that the segment is transmitted properly.
- It is a best effort delivery protocol. There is no acknowledgment that the data is received at the destination.

  ### UDP Header
  UDP header has only has **four fields and requires 8 bytes (i.e., 64 bits).**
   
  **8 fields of UDP header**
  - source port = identify the source application by port number
  - destinaation port = identify the destination application ny port number
  - length = length of the UDP datagram header
  - checksum = used for error checking of the UDP datagram header and data

  ### Applications that use UDP
  - DHCP
  - DNS
  - SNMP
  - TFTP
  - VoIP
  - Video conferencing

Although DNS and SNMP use UDP by default, both can also use TCP. DNS will use TCP if the DNS request or DNS response is more than 512 bytes, such as when a DNS response includes many name resolutions.

### UDP Communication

  ### UDP Datagram reassembly
  - UDP does not track sequence numbers as TCP does. As a result, it has no way to reorder the datagrams into their transmission order.
  - UDP only reassembles the data in the oder that it was received and forwards to the application.
