# 04.Ethernet
Ethernet is a type of wired protocol which uses a suite of protocols that allows network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. 

An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media such as Unshielded twised pair cable (UTP). combinnes the physical layer devices and data link layer protocols

### Logical link control (LLC)
LLC handles the communication between the upper and lower layers.

### Media Access Control (MAC)
- Frame assembly before transmission and frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.
- MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU

Provides three primary functions:
▪ Frame delimiting – Identifies a group of bits that make up a frame, 
synchronization between the transmitting and receiving nodes.
▪ Addressing – Each Ethernet header added in the frame contains the 
physical address (MAC address) that enables a frame to be delivered to a 
destination node.
▪ Error detection – Each Ethernet frame contains a trailer with a cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC) of the frame contents.

### Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
CSMA is **located in the trailer of the ethernet frame** in which it is used to resolve media contention. It provides collision detection. It checks if the media is carrying a signal before transmitting data. 

The MAC address is used by the switch to determine if it is unicast, multicast or broadcast.
