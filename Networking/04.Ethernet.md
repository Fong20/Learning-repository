# 04.Ethernet
- Ethernet is a type of wired protocol which uses a suite of protocols that allows network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. 
- An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media such as Unshielded twised pair cable (UTP). combinnes the physical layer devices and data link layer protocols
- Ethernet protocol consists of the physical layer and data link layer.
- The IEEE 802.3 is also known as the Ethernet standard and defines the physical and media access control (MAC) of the data link layer for wired Ethernet networks.

## 4.1 Ethernet protocol

### Logical link control sublayer (LLC)
LLC handles the communication between the upper and lower layers.

### Media Access Control sublayer (MAC)

**Data encapsulation**
- Performs Frame assembly before transmission and frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.
- MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU
- It is also responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media.

Provides three primary functions:
▪ Frame delimiting – Identifies a group of bits that make up a frame, synchronization between the transmitting and receiving nodes.
▪ Addressing – Each Ethernet header added in the frame contains the physical address (MAC address) that enables a frame to be delivered to a destination node.
▪ Error detection – Each Ethernet frame contains a trailer with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the frame contents.

### Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
CSMA is used to resolve media contention. It provides collision detection/collision avoidance. It checks if the media is carrying a signal before transmitting data.

**Key notes:**


**CSMA Collision detection**
- CSMA collision detection is used for Ethernet networks.

### MAC Address
- MAC address is a **layer 2 protocol which consists of 48 bits (12 hexadecimal digits because hexadecimal contains 4 bits)**
- The **first 24 bits represent the Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)** which is the manufacturer while the **remaining 24 bits represent the unique Network interface card (NIC) id for the device.**

- MAC address is fixed.
- MAC address is represented in hexadecimal notation
- To find the MAC address, we can type in ipconfig /all in the command prompt.

### Ethernet frame size
- Ethernet II and IEEE 802.3 standards define the minimum frame size as 64 bytes and the maximum as 1518 bytes.
- Frames with less than 64 bytes are known as collision fragment or runt frame
- If the size of a transmitted frame is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum, the receiving device drops the frame.

### How is the frame processed?
- When a device is forwarding a message through an Ethernet network, it attaches header information to the packet which contains the source and destination MAC address.
- Each NIC views information to see if the destination MAC address in the frame matches the device’s physical MAC address stored in RAM.
- If it is matching, it keeps the frame and analyzes it. Otherwise, the device discards the frame.

### How is data transferred based on the type of communication:
In order for a network intermediary device to know what type of communication is performed (unicast, multicast or broadcast), there must be a certain destination MAC address format to  allow the network intermediary device to determine which port to transmit the data.

  ### Unicast
- For unicast, we use the specific destination MAC address/IP address.

  ### Broadcast
- For broadcast, the destination MAC address is FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
- For broadcast, the destination ip address 192.168.1.255

  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/0da802ac-6714-400a-9232-41840c91a5d8)

  ### Multicast
- For multicast, the destinatiion MAC address for IPv4 multicast address starts with 01-00-5E
- For multicast, the destinatiion MAC address for IPv6 multicast address starts with 33-33
- For multicast, the destinatiion IPv4 address starts with 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. The range of IPv6 multicast addresses begins with ff00::/8.

### MAC address vs IP address
- **MAC address is fixed whereas as it is embedded inside the NIC** whereas the **IP address can change based on the location.**
- **MAC address is represented in hexadecimal** while **IP address is represented in decimal.**
- **MAC address is analyzed by the switch** whereas **IP address is analyzed by the router.**

Premable = Synchronization between the transmitter and receiver.

## 4.2 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Usually when we transfer data, we don't know the destination MAC address but we know the destination IP address because of the DNS. Thus, **we use ARP to find the destination MAC address that is mapped to the destination IPV4 address.** It does so by sending the ARP request (destination IP address) to all devices to check if destination IP address is the same. If it is the same, it will send back the information of the destination of the MAC address and its ip address to the source end device. The source end device then adds the destination MAC address and IP address into the ARP table.
-  ARP messages have a type field of 0x806. This informs the receiving NIC that the data portion of the frame needs to be passed to the ARP process.

### ARP Table
- The ARP Table is used to find the MAC address that is mapped to the destination IPv4 address. 
- The ARP table contains the MAC address and the IP address.
- The ARP table is stored on the RAM.
- As a node receives frames from the media, it records the source IP and MAC address as a mapping in the ARP table.
- Entries in the ARP table are time stamped. If a device does not receive a frame from a particular device before the timestamp expires, the entry for this device is removed from the ARP table.

### ARP Request
- ARP Request is a layer 2 broadcast to all devices on the Ethernet LAN.
- As an ARP request is sent, it is sent to all nodes. If the node matches the IP address, it will reply by sending the MAC address back to the source end device.
- If no device responds to the ARP request( IP address does not match), the packet is dropped because a frame cannot be created.
- If too many devices request ARP request, it will cause network congestions. To rectify this issue, we segment the devices into multiple LAN's by performing subnetting.

### ARP Reply
Once the device finds out that its IPv4 address is associated with the ARP request, it will respond with an ARP reply. The ARP reply is a unicast reply.

The ARP reply is encapsulated in an Ethernet frame using the following header information:
- Destination MAC address = This is the MAC address of the sender of the ARP request.
- Source MAC address = This is the MAC address of the sender of the ARP reply.
- Type = ARP messages have a type field of 0x806. This informs the receiving NIC that the data portion of the frame needs to be passed to the ARP process.

### ARP Spoofing
- In some cases, the use of ARP can lead to a potential security risk. A threat actor can use ARP spoofing to perform an ARP poisoning attack. This is a technique used by a threat actor to reply to an ARP request for an IPv4 address that belongs to another device.
- The threat actor sends an ARP reply with its own MAC address. The receiver of the ARP reply will add the wrong MAC address to its ARP table and send these packets to the threat actor.

  
### ARP Role in Remote Communication
- If the destination host is in the same LAN, the frame will use the MAC address of the device as the destination MAC address
- If the destination host is in different networks, the source will send an ARP request which compares with the default gateway IP address.
- In the event that the gateway entry is not in the table, an ARP request is used to retrieve the MAC address associated with the IP address of the router interface.
- To mitigate this issue, enterprise level switches include mitigation techniques known as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI).

### Removal of entries from the ARP table
- Because IP addresses can change according to the location, it will disrupt the ARP table.
- The ARP cache timer removes ARP entries that have not been used for a specified period of time.
- Commands may also be used to manually remove all or some of the entries in the ARP table.

## 4.3 LAN Switches

### Layer 2 LAN Switches
- An intermediary network device which connects all end devices in a network.
- Performs switching and filtering based on the MAC address
- Builds a MAC address table to make forwarding decisions
- Requires a router to transfer data to other networks.

### Layer 3 Switch
- It is a combination of a switch and a router in a single device (2 in 1).
- Main purpose is to reduce the Latency in a network. (Computation + Propagation + Transmission latency).
- It does so by reducing the computation latency as the function of the router is now embedded into the switch itself.

### MAC Address Table
It is used by the switch to make switching decisions.

### How switches work using the MAC address table
1. When The switch receives a frame, it will check the source MAC address.
2. If the source MAC address is not found in the MAC address table, the switch records the source MAC address and the switch port that received the frame into the MAC address table.
3. It then checks the destination MAC address of the frame if it is in the MAC address table. If it is not inside the MAC address table, the switch broadcasts the frame to all ports except for the port which received the frame.
4. The destination device replies to the broadcasted frame with a unicast frame addressed to PC 1.
5. Before the unicast frame can reach PC1,the switch records the MAC address and the port number of the switch port of the destination device into the MAC address table. The destination MAC address and its associated port can now be found in the MAC address table as well.
6. The switch can now forward the frame to PC1. It is able to forward frames between source and destination devices without flooding as the switch has the entries in the address table that identify the associated ports.

### Hub vs Switches
- A switch is generally more intelligent compared to a hub.
- Most of the current networks utilize a switch rather than a hub.

### Auto-MDIX
With Auto-MDIX, the device is able to detect the type of device connected at the other end and determine the type of connection required as well as configure the interface accordingly.

### Switching methods on Cisco switches
Switching Methods **determine how a switch receives, processes, and forwards a Layer 2 Ethernet frame.**
**There are generally two types of switching methods:**
- store and forward
- cut through

### Store and forward
- In store and forward method, it will check the received frame and compute Cyclic Redundency Check (CRC) for any errors. If the CRC has error, the ethernet frame will be dropped. If the CRC is valid, it will then look into the destination MAC address and send the frame to the destination through the correct port.
- Store and Forward switching can **cause delay in switching since Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is calculated for each Ethernet frame.**

### Cut-through switching
Generally, **cut-through switching forwards the frame before it is entirely received.** The **destination MAC address is the minimum criteria to be met before it can be forwarded.**

  ### Fast-forward switching
  Fast forward switching has the lowest level of latency as it immediately forwards the packet to the destination after reading the destination address. However, the main problem of fast-forward swtitching is that it might send bad frames.

  ### Fragment-free switching
  The switch stores the first 64 bytes of the frame before making a switching decision, most network errors and collisions occur at the first 64 bytes.

### Memory buffer on switches

  ### Port-based memory
  - The memory is allocated to all individual ports in the switch.
  - The frames are stored in queues that are linked to specific incoming and outgoing ports.

  ### Shared memory
  - Memory is shared among all ports in the switch.
  - The frames are stored into a common memory which the ports share. It is kess efficient as the algorithm needs to search the whole memory for the data.

### Power over Ethernet
The ethernet cable can actually provide sufficient power to run a device which do not require much power such as the IP phone.
