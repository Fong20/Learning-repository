# 04.Ethernet
- Ethernet is a type of wired protocol which uses a suite of protocols that allows network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. 
- An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media such as Unshielded twised pair cable (UTP). combinnes the physical layer devices and data link layer protocols
- Ethernet protocol consists of the physical layer and data link layer.

## 4.1 Ethernet protocol

### Logical link control sublayer (LLC)
LLC handles the communication between the upper and lower layers.

### Media Access Control sublayer (MAC)

**Data encapsulation**
- Performs Frame assembly before transmission and frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.
- MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU
- It is also responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media.

Provides three primary functions:
▪ Frame delimiting – Identifies a group of bits that make up a frame, synchronization between the transmitting and receiving nodes.
▪ Addressing – Each Ethernet header added in the frame contains the physical address (MAC address) that enables a frame to be delivered to a destination node.
▪ Error detection – Each Ethernet frame contains a trailer with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the frame contents.

### Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
CSMA is used to resolve media contention. It provides collision detection/collision avoidance. It checks if the media is carrying a signal before transmitting data.

**Key notes:**


**CSMA Collision detection**
- CSMA collision detection is used for Ethernet networks.

**CSMA Collision avoidance**
- CSMA collision avoidance is used for wireless networks. It is found in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking technologies.

### MAC Address
- MAC address is a **layer 2 protocol which consists of 48 bits (12 hexadecimal digits because hexadecimal contains 4 bits)**
- The **first 24 bits represent the Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)** which is the manufacturer while the **remaining 24 bits represent the unique Network interface card (NIC) id for the device.**

- MAC address is fixed.
- MAC address is represented in hexadecimal notation
- To find the MAC address, we can type in ipconfig /all in the command prompt.

### How is the frame processed?
- When a device is forwarding a message through an Ethernet network, it attaches header information to the packet which contains the source and destination MAC address.
- Each NIC views information to see if the destination MAC address in the frame matches the device’s physical MAC address stored in RAM.
- If it is matching, it keeps the frame and analyzes it. Otherwise, the device discards the frame.

### How is data transferred based on the type of communication:
In order for a network intermediary device to know what type of communication is performed (unicast, multicast or broadcast), there must be a certain destination MAC address format to  allow the network intermediary device to determine which port to transmit the data.

  ### Unicast
- For unicast, we use the specific destination MAC address/IP address.

  ### Broadcast
- For broadcast, the destination MAC address is FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
- For broadcast, the destination ip address 192.168.1.255

  ### Multicast
- For multicast, the destinatiion MAC address starts with 01-00-5E
- For multicast, the destinatiion MAC address starts with 224.0.0.200

### MAC address vs IP address
- **MAC address is fixed whereas as it is embedded inside the NIC** whereas the **IP address can change based on the location.**
- **MAC address is represented in hexadecimal** while **IP address is represented in decimal.**
- **MAC address is analyzed by the switch** whereas **IP address is analyzed by the router.**

Premable = Synchronization between the transmitter and receiver.

## 4.2 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Usually when we transfer data, we don't know the destination MAC address but we know the destination IP address because of the DNS. Thus, we use ARP to find the destination MAC address that is mapped to the destination IPV4 address. It does so by sending the ARP request (destination IP address) to all devices to check if destination IP address is the same. If it is the same, it will send back the information of the destination of the MAC address to the source end device in an ARP table
- The ARP table contains the MAC address and the IP address.
- If too many devices request ARP request, it will cause network congestions. To rectify this issue, we segment the devices into multiple LAN's
