# 03. Network access

## 3.1 Physical layer protocols

### Getting the device connected to the network
- Connect the device to the router through the ethernet port
- If it wireless, then there is no need to connect through ethernet port.

### Physical layer media
There are generally three types of signal:

When we use copper cable as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of an Electrical signal.

When we use fiber optic cable as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of light pulse.

When we use wireless as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of Microwave signal

Bandwidth = amount of data we can send in a specific amount of time

## 3.2 Network media

### Network interferrence
There is signal interferrence when transferring data accross the network due to noise. Therefore, network medias use several methods to reduce the signal interferrence.

### Copper cable

For copper cables, there are three types:
- unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP)
- shielded twisted pair cable (STP)
- coaxial cable

**Unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP)**

UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI. Instead, cable designers have discovered that they can limit the negative 
effect of crosstalk by varying the number of twists per wire pair.

**Shielded twisted pair cable (STP)**
The twisted pairs are shielded by the foil shield in a twisted pair cable (STP).

### Fiber optic cabling
- Fiber optic cabling is gaining attraction due to its higher data rate and bandwidth. It is also more resistant to electromagnetic interferrence (EMI) and radio interferrence (RFI).
- To test the fiber optic cables, we can use a device known as **Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR)**

**Two types of fiber optic cable:**
- **single mode** (transfer one signal at a time)
- **multi mode** (transfer miltiple signals at a time)

**Fiber optic connectors:**

### Fiber vs Copper cable

### Factors to consider when choosing a network media:
- Purpose of the network
- Bandwidth/transmission rate
- Cost

Fiber optic cable has the highest bandwidth/data rate but it the most costly to implement.
Copper is cheap to implement but has lower bandwidth/data rate
Wireless is in the middle ground where it is less expensive than fiber optic but still offers good bandwidth/data rate.

### Wireless media

Wireless has few concerns such as:
- coverage area
- interferrence
- security

**Types of wireless media**

**WIFI**
- WIFI uses IEEE 802.11 standard protocol.
- There are different 802.11 wifi standards set by the IEEE for wireless WIFI media.
- IEEE 802.11b/g supports only 2.4 ghz frequency range.
- IEEE 802.11a supports only 5 ghz frequency range.
- IEEE 802.11ad/n supports both 2.4 and 5 ghz frequency range.

**Bluetooth**
- Bluetooth is used to connect peripherals/ transmit data in a close range.
- It uses IEEE 802.15 standard protocol.
  
**Improtant terms for wireless settings**

**Service set identifier (SSID)** = It is the name of the network. It is is case-sensitive, alphanumeric string and supports up to 32 characters.

**SSID Broadcast** = Determines if the SSID will be broadcasted/visible to all devices within range. if SSID broadcast is off, you will need to connect to the network manually.

**Standard channel** = Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the access point (AP) to determine the optimum channel to use.

**Access point** = Determines what 802.11 protocol the router uses. For example, if a device only has the necessary radio for 802.11 b/g, it will not connect if the wireless router or access point is configured to only accept 802.11n or 802.11ac standards.

**Network mode** = Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n or Mixed Mode. Mixed mode allows devices which supports multiple 802.11 protocols to connect to the network.

**MAC filtering** = Restricts a device from accessing the network.

**Guess mode** = Restricts the usage of the device to only internet access.

## 3.3 Data link layer protocol
- The data link layer protocol is responsible for controlling the transfer of frames accross the media. It governs how the frame is formatted which allows devices to communicate with each other despite using different network medias.
- An intermediary network device accepts the frame from one medium, decapsulates it and forwards the packets in a new frame. The headers the frame are formatted for the specific medium that it will cross.
- **All data link layer protocols encapsulate the Layer 3 PDU within the data field of the frame.**

### Data link sublayers
The data link sublayer consists of LLC sublayer and MAC sublayer.

### Media access control (MAC)
- Allocate some resources to ensure that the connection oeprates smoothly.
- It is a layer 2 address (data link layer)

### Frame structure in the data link layer/ layer 2 frame structure
- The structure of the frame consists of the**header, packet(data) and trailer.**
- There are **specific bit patterns** which **denotes the start of the frame and the end of the frame.**

### Header of data link frame
- The **header** consists of the **frame start, MAC address of the source of the source and destination**, **type of protocol and control.**

### Trailer of data link frame
The **trailer** consists of **frame check sequence (FCS) and frame stop**

## 3.5 Network Topologies
Network Topology defines the structure of the network of how the components are interconnected with each other.

### Physical vs Logical Topologies
Physical topology** reflects the physical layout of devices and cables to a form a connected network** while logical topology **refects on the arrangement of the devices and their communication.**

### Physical WAN topologies
- point to point topology
- hub and spoke topology
- mesh topology

### Physical LAN topologies
- star topology
- extended star topology
- bus topology
- ring topology

### Point to point topology
Point to point topology is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other is the receiver.

## Data transmission modes

### simplex 
It is a one way transmission. There is Only one transmitter and the others are receivers.

### Half-duplex
Eg: Walkie-talkie

### Full-duplex
It is a two way communication. An individual is able to send and receive data at the same time.

### Contention based access vs Controlled based access
Contention based access sends the data without any order which will cause interuption whereas controlled based access sends the data based on an order.

### Data link layer frame
A frame in the data link layer consists of header, data and trailer.

### Header
Start frame, MAC address and the type of protocol/length of the message

### Trailer
- The trailer of the frame consists of the FCS and stop frame.
- The FrameCheck Sequence (FCS) is used for error checking whereas the stop frame is an optional field whereby indicates the end of the frame when the length of the frame is not specified.
