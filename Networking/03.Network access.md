# 03. Network access

## 3.1 Physical layer protocols

### Getting the device connected to the network
- Connect the device to the router through the ethernet port
- If it wireless, then there is no need to connect through ethernet port.

### Physical layer media
There are generally three types of signal:

When we use copper cable as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of an Electrical signal.

When we use fiber optic cable as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of light pulse.

When we use wireless as the network media to transfer data in the network, it is transfering data in the form of Microwave signal

Bandwidth = amount of data we can send in a specific amount of time

## 3.2 Network media

### Network interferrence
There is signal interferrence when transferring data accross the network due to noise. Therefore, network medias use several methods to reduce the signal interferrence.

### Copper cable

For copper cables, there are three types:
- unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP)
- shielded twisted pair cable (STP)
- coaxial cable

**Unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP)**

UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI. Instead, cable designers have discovered that they can limit the negative 
effect of crosstalk by varying the number of twists per wire pair.

**Coaxial cable**


### Fiber optic cabling
Fiber optic cabling is gaining attraction due to its higher data rate and bandwidth. It is also more resistant to electromagnetic interferrence (EMI) and radio interferrence (RFI).

Two types of fiber optic cable:
- single mode (transfer one signal at a time)
- multi mode (transfer miltiple signals at a time)


To test the fiber optic cables, we can use a device known as **Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR)**

### Fiber vs Copper cable

### Factors to consider when choosing a network media:
- Purpose of the network
- Bandwidth/transmission rate
- Cost

Fiber optic cable has the highest bandwidth/data rate but it the most costly to implement.
Copper is cheap to implement but has lower bandwidth/data rate
Wireless is in the middle ground where it is less expensive than fiber optic but still offers good bandwidth/data rate.

### Wireless media

Wireless has few concerns such as:
- coverage area
- interferrence
- security

**802.11 wifi standards for wireless media**

There are different 802.11 wifi standards set by the IEEE for wireless WIFI media.

## 3.3 Data link layer protocol
Allows devices to communicate with each other despite using different network medias.


### Data link sublayers
The data link sublayer consists of LLC sublayer and MAC sublayer.

### Media access control (MAC)
- Allocate some resources to ensure that the connection oeprates smoothly.
- It is a layer 2 address (data link layer)

**Data link layer standards**


## 3.5 Common WAN topologies
- point to point topology
- star topology
- mesh topology
- bus topology
- ring topology

### Point to point topology


simplex 
It is a one way transmission. Only one transmitter and the others are receivers.

Half-duplex
Eg: 

Full-duplex
It is a two way communication. Able to send and receive data at the same time.

Contention based access vs Controlled based access
Contention based access sends the data without any order which will cause interuption whereas controlled based access sends the data based on an order.

### Data link frame
consists of header, data and trailer.

### Header
Start frame, MAC address and the type of protocol/length of the message

### Trailer
The trailer of the frame consists of the FCS and stop frame
FrameCheck Sequence (FCS) is used for error detection
