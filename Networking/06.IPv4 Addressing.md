# 06.IPv4 

## 6.1 IPv4 address structure
An IPv4 is a **32 bit address consisting of the network portion and host portion.**

### Network and host portion
- network portion = destination of the network.
- host portion = destination of the device in the network.

### Subnet mask
**Subnet mask identifies the network and host portions of the IPv4 address.** It just tells the computer where to look for the part of the IPv4 address that is the network portion and which part is the host portion. The network portion consists of all 1's in the subnet mask while the host portion consista of all 0's in the subnet mask.

### The prefix length
**Prefix length tells us how many bits which belong to the network portion. **The **maximum bits which can be allocated to the network portion is 30.** We need to allocate remaining 2 bits to the host portion.

Eg: 255.0.0.0 is equivalent to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 in binary. There are 8 one's which means that the network portion consists of 8 bits whereas the remaining 24 bits are the host portion. The prefix length is written in /8.

Once we have indentified the number of bits for the network portion, we can find the number of bits for the host portion by deducting 32 with the number of bits for the network portion. After that, we can identify the number of ip addresses which can be allocated to the host by using the formula **2 power number of bits allocated to the host portion - 2
** We minus 2 because there is network address and the broadcast address which cannot be assigned to host.

### Determining the network address
To identify the network address, we perform **AND oepration** betweeen the **host address and the subnet mask.**

### Network, host and broadcast address
- network address (Eg: 192.168.10.0) = Represents all the devices on the same network.
- host address (Eg: 192.168.10.1) = Represents the address of the host on the network.
- broadcast address (the IP address ends with .255, Eg: 192.168.10.255)

## 6.2 IPv4 addresses based on the type of communication (unicast, multicast and broadcast)

### Unicast
For unicast transmission, the **packet is transmitted to a single device based on its destination IPv4 address.**

### Multicast
For multicast transmission, the **packet is transmitted to multiple device based on a multicast group address.**

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/8a84ea05-0f91-49ce-a0d4-b47ec0e05fab)

### Broadcast
For broadcast transmission, the **packet is transmitted to all devices in the network based on a unique destination IPv4 address.** Eg: 172.16.4.255, the .255 means it is a broadcast transmission.

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/35c74e34-e1fe-410e-9631-47df06a2cde9)

Note: There are **two special reserved address on every network that cannot be assigned to the host:**
- network address
- broadcast address

## 6.3 Types of IPv4 addresses

There are generally two types of IPv4 addresses:
- public
- private

Private IPv4 addresses are not unique which means there can be identical IPv4 addresses on different devices in different network. 

public IPv4 addresses are globally routable but private IPv4 address are not globally routable. To transmit private addresses, the router must have a public address.

Common private IPv4 addresses:
- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

### Network address translation (NAT)
Private IPv4 addresses are not unique which means there can be identical IPv4 addresses on different devices. To avoid conflict between data transmission, NAT is used to translate private IPv4 address to public IPv4 address.

### Special usage of IPv4 addresses

**Loopback address**
Loopback address (127.0.0.1) is used to verify the TCP/IP stack  is operational/working fine.

### Legacy classful addressing
RFC 790 allocated IPv4 address in classes.

Classes:
- class A (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8)
- class B (128.0.0.0 /16 – 191.255.0.0 /16)
- class C (192.0.0.0 /24 – 223.255.255.0 /24)
- class D (224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0)
- class E (240.0.0.0 – 255.0.0.0)

It was found that **classful addressing wasted many IPv4 addresses.** Thus, **classful addressing was replaced with classless addressing which ignores the rules of classes (A, B, C).**

### Assignment of IP address
- The **internet assigned numbers authority (IANA)** **manages and allocates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).**

- The **RIRs are then responsible to provide the IP addresses to ISPs who provide IPv4 addresses to smaller ISPs and organizations.**

## 6.4 Network segmentation
Many protocols such as ARP and DHCP send requests which causes the network to be sluggish as the network is filled with broadcast/multicast signals. 

The router is the only device which is able to stop the broadcasts. Routers do not propagate broadcasts. Each router interface connects to a broadcast domain and broadcasts are only propagated within that specific broadcast domain.

### Subnetting
To solve the issue, we **reduce the size of the network by creating smaller broadcasting domain.** This process is known as subnetting. Subenetting reduces the number of devicea affected by the broadcasting signals overall network which imporves network performance. When performing subnetting, we need to change the IP address of each subnet

**Subnetting can be done based:**
- location (floor
- group or function
- device type (pc, printer etc)

### How to perform subnetting?

### Subnet bits
- subnet bits = bits which are borrowed from the network portion.
- By looking at the subnet bits, we are able to know how many subnetworks we can create by following the below formula:

Number of subnets = 2 power number of subnet bits

### Magic number technique
The magic number is basically the place value of the last 1 in the subnet mask. Once we get the magic number,  we are able to identify the network address of the next subnetworks. The subnets will increment based on the place value.

For class A addressing, the second octet is incremented by one whereas the third octet is incremented based on the place value.
