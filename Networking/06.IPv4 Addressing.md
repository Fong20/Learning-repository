# 06.IPv4 Addressing

## 6.1 IPv4 address structure
- An IPv4 is a 32 bit address
- It consists of the network portion and host portion

### Network and host portion
- network portion = destination of the network.
- host portion = destination of the device in the network.

### Subnet mask
Subnet mask = identifies the network and host portions of the IPv4. It network portion consists of all 1's in the subnet mask while the host portion consista of all 0's in the subnet mask.

To identify the network address, we need to perform AND oepration betweeen the host address and the subnet mask

To identify the number of ip addresses which can be allocated to the host, we use the formula 2 power number of bits allocated to the host portion.

### The prefix length
prefix length means the first number of bits belong to the network portion. The maximum bits which can be allocated to the network portion is 30. We need to allocate remaining 2 bits to the host portion

### 6.3 Types of IPv4 address
- network address
- host address
- broadcast address (ends with .255)
- public
- private

### Network address translation
It is used to translate private IPv4 address to public IPv4 address.

Loopback address (127.0.0.1) is used to verify the TCP/IP is operational is working fine.

### Legacy classful addressing
RFC 790 allocated IPv4 address in classes.

Classes:
- class A
- class B
- class C
- class D
- class E

### Assignment of IP address

## 6.4 Network segmentation
subentting reduces overall network traffic and imporves network performance.

Subnets 
-location
- group or function
- device type
