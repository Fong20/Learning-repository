# 06.IPv4 Addressing

## 6.1 IPv4 address structure
An IPv4 is a 32 bit address consisting of the network portion and host portion

### Network and host portion
- network portion = destination of the network.
- host portion = destination of the device in the network.

### Subnet mask
Subnet mask identifies the network and host portions of the IPv4 address. The network portion consists of all 1's in the subnet mask while the host portion consista of all 0's in the subnet mask.

### The prefix length
Prefix length tells us how many bits which belong to the network portion. The maximum bits which can be allocated to the network portion is 30. We need to allocate remaining 2 bits to the host portion.

Eg: 255.0.0.0 is equivalent to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 in binary. There are 8 one's which means that the network portion consists of 8 bits whereas the remaining 24 bits are the host portion. The prefix length is written in /8.

Once we have indentified the number of bits for the network portion, we can find the number of bits for the host portion by deducting 32 with the number of bits for the network portion. After that, we can identify the number of ip addresses which can be allocated to the host by using the formula **2 power number of bits allocated to the host portion.

### Determining the network address
To identify the network address, we perform **AND oepration** betweeen the **host address and the subnet mask.**

### Network, host and broadcast address
- network address (Eg: 192.168.10.0)
- host address (Eg: 192.168.10.1)
- broadcast address (the IP address ends with .255, Eg: 192.168.10.255)

## 6.2 IPv4 addresses based on the type of communication (unicast, multicast and broadcast)

### Unicast
For unicast transmission, the packet is transmitted to a single device based on its destination IPv4 address.

### Multicast
For multicast transmission, the packet is transmitted to multiple device based on a multicast group address.

### Broadcast
For broadcast transmission, the packet is transmitted to all devices in the network based on a unique destination IPv4 address. Eg: 172.16.4.255, the .255 means it is a broadcast transmission.

## 6.3 Types of IPv4 addresses

There are generally two types of IPv4 addresses:
- public
- private

Private IPv4 addresses are not unique which means there can be identical IPv4 addresses on different devices in different network. To avoid conflict between data transmission, we

public IPv4 addresses are globally routable but private IPv4 address are not globally routable. To transmit private addresses, the router must have a public address.

Common private IPv4 addresses:
- 10.0.0.0
- 172.16.0.0
- 192.168.0.0

### Network address translation (NAT)
Private IPv4 addresses are not unique which means there can be identical IPv4 addresses on different devices. To avoid conflict between data transmission, NAT is used to translate private IPv4 address to public IPv4 address.

### Special usage of IPv4 addresses

**Loopback address**
Loopback address (127.0.0.1) is used to verify the TCP/IP stack  is operational/working fine.

### Legacy classful addressing
RFC 790 allocated IPv4 address in classes.

Classes:
- class A
- class B
- class C
- class D
- class E

It was found that classful addressing wasted many IPv4 addresses. Thus, classful addressing was replaced with classless addressing which ignores the rules of classes (A, B, C).

### Assignment of IP address
The internet assigned numbers authority (IANA) manages and allocates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).

The RIRs are then responsible to provide the IP addresses to ISPs who provide IPv4 addresses to smaller ISPs and organizations

## 6.4 Network segmentation
subentting reduces overall network traffic and imporves network performance.

Subnets 
-location
- group or function
- device type
