# IPv6 addressing

## Migration techniques to IPv6
Dual stack = devices can run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol.
Tunneling = A method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network.
Translation

## IPv6 addressing formats
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits

## IPv6 address representation
- A double colon can replace any

## IPv6 address type

### unicast
- Global unicast address (GUA). This is similar to a pulbic IPv4 address. It starts with 2001
contains 3 parts
- global routing prefix
- subnet id
- interface id

- Link local address. It starts with fe80.

### multicast
ff02::1 is used for all nodes multicast group.

### anycast
IPv6 has no broadcast but it is replaced with anycast

## IPv6 prefix length
The recommended prefix length for IPv6 addresses is /64

Prefix = network portion
interface ID = host portion


## Dynamic addressing for IPv6 GUA
There are two ways to 
EUI-64 method provides a 64 bit interface ID based on the device's MAC address. It basically adds the remain 16 bits to produce a 64 bit interface ID since the MAC address is only 48 bits.
