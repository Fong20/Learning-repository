# IPv6 addressing
One of the main issues of IPv4 is the depletion of ip address space. Thus, IPv6 was introduced to rectify the issue.

## Migration techniques to IPv6
The IETF has created various protocols to assist in the transition to IPv6. The protocols are as listed below:
- Dual stack = devices can run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol.
- Tunneling = Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet.
- Translation. This allows IPv6 enable devices to communicate with IPv4 enabled devices. This can be done through NAT64.

## IPv6 address general structure and prefix length

### General structure
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written in hexadecimal format. It consists of 8 hextets (1 hextet = 4 hexadecimals/16 bits)
- IPv6 addresses are not case sensitive.

An Ipv6 address consists of:
- prefix = network portion of the address
- interface id = host portion of the address

### Prefix length
- The prefix length is used to determine the network portion of the IPv6 address. It is represented in slash notation.
- The IPv6 prefix length can range from 0 to 128 bits but it is generally recommended to be 64 bit for most networks. When 64 bits is allocated for the prefix, the interface id is also 64 bits. SLACC normally uses 64 bits for the interface ID.

## Shortening the IPv6 address
There are several ways to reduce the complicity of IPv6 addresses:

  ### Rule 1: Omit Leading Zeros. 
  This involves removing any leading 0s
  
  Eg: 01ab can be represented by 1ab, 0a00 can be represented by a00.

  ### Rule 2: Using double colon 
  We use double colon to replace any string consisting of all 0s consistently.

  Eg: 2001:0db8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200 can be represented by 2001:db8:0:1111::200

## IPv6 address type
- An Ipv6 packet can be transmitted through three data transmission types, which is unicast, multicast and anycast.
- **IPv6 does not have broadcast.** It is **replaced with all nodes multicast address** which provides the same functionality.

### unicast

  ### Global unicast address (GUA). 
  - A global unicast address is similar to a pulbic IPv4 address. It is globally unique, internet routable addresses.
  - It starts with 2001
  
contains 3 parts
- global routing prefix
- subnet id
- interface id

  ### Link local address (LLA).
  - Link local address is used to communicate with devices on the same network. They are not routable as they are confined to a single link
  - It starts with fe80.

### multicast
ff02::1 is used for all nodes multicast group.

### anycast
An anycast IPv6 address is an IPv6 unicast address that is assigned to multiple devices. The packet sent to the anycast address is sent according to the nearest device which contains the anycast address. An IPv6 has no specific prefix


## Dynamic addressing for IPv6 GUA
There are two ways to 
EUI-64 method provides a 64 bit interface ID based on the device's MAC address. It basically adds the remain 16 bits to produce a 64 bit interface ID since the MAC address is only 48 bits.
