# IPv6 addressing
One of the main issues of IPv4 is the depletion of ip address space. Thus, IPv6 was introduced to rectify the issue.

## Migration techniques to IPv6
The IETF has created various protocols to assist in the transition to IPv6. The protocols are as listed below:
- Dual stack = devices can run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol.
- Tunneling = Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet.
- Translation. This allows IPv6 enable devices to communicate with IPv4 enabled devices. This can be done through NAT64.

## IPv6 address general structure and prefix length

### General structure
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written in hexadecimal format. It consists of 8 hextets (1 hextet = 4 hexadecimals/16 bits)
- IPv6 addresses are not case sensitive.

An Ipv6 address consists of:
- prefix = network portion of the address
- interface id = host portion of the address

### Prefix length
- The prefix length is used to determine the network portion of the IPv6 address. It is represented in slash notation.
- The IPv6 prefix length can range from 0 to 128 bits but it is generally recommended to be 64 bit for most networks. When 64 bits is allocated for the prefix, the interface id is also 64 bits. SLACC normally uses 64 bits for the interface ID.

## Shortening the IPv6 address
There are several ways to reduce the complicity of IPv6 addresses:

  ### Rule 1: Omit Leading Zeros. 
  This involves removing any leading 0s
  
  Eg: 01ab can be represented by 1ab, 0a00 can be represented by a00.

  ### Rule 2: Using double colon 
  We use double colon to replace any string consisting of all 0s consistently.

  Eg: 2001:0db8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200 can be represented by 2001:db8:0:1111::200

## IPv6 address type
- An Ipv6 packet can be transmitted through three data transmission types, which is unicast, multicast and anycast.
- **IPv6 does not have broadcast.** It is **replaced with all nodes multicast address** which provides the same functionality.

  ### Unicast
  ### Global unicast address (GUA). 
  - A global unicast address is similar to a pulbic IPv4 address. It is globally unique, internet routable addresses.
  - It starts with 2001

  ### Structure of GUA:
  The IPv6 GUA structure consists of three main parts which are:
  - Global routing prefix. It is the network portion of the GUA address that is assigned by the ISP.
  - Subnet ID. It is the area in between the global routing prefix and the interface id. It is used to identify subnets within its side.
  - Interface ID. It is the host portion of the GUA

  ### Assigning GUA manually on cisco routers

  ### Link local address (LLA).
  - Link local address is used to communicate with devices on the same network. They are not globally routable as they are confined to a single link
  - Link local addresses range from fc00::/7 to fdff::/7 but link local addresses normally starts with fe80.
  - If an LLA is not configured manually on an interface, the device will automatically create and assign one.

Note: We need to provide both global unicast address and link local address when configuring devices with IPv6 addresses.

  ### Multicast
  There are two types of multicast addresses:
  - well-known multicast addresses
  - solicated node multicast addresses

  ### Well-known multicast addresses
  ### All nodes multicast
  - All nodes multicast is similar to broadcast 
  - ff02::1 is used for all nodes multicast group.

  ### Solicited node multicast address
  - Solicited node multicast address is similar to all nodes multicast.
  - It is mapped to the ehtenet multicast address whereby the ethernet NIC will check the frame by examining the destination MAC address without the need of sending it to IPv6 process to see if the device is the intended target of the IPv6 packet.
    
  ### All routers multicast
  ### Anycast
  - An anycast IPv6 address is an IPv6 unicast address that is assigned to multiple devices. The packet sent to the anycast    address is sent according to the nearest device which contains the anycast address. An IPv6 has no specific prefix

## Dynamic addressing for IPv6 GUA
Generally, devices obtain GUA addresses dynamically through Internet Control Message Protcol version 6 protocol (ICMPv6).

### How it works?
Router Solicitation (RS): Messages are sent by the host to discover IPv6 routers and identify how to obtain IPv6 GUA addresses.

Router Advertisement (RA): Reply message is sent by the router to inform the host on how to obtain the IPv6 GUA addresses and provides useful information such as the network prefix and prefix length, default gateway address and dns addresses and domain name

Router advertisement provides three methods for configuring IPv6 GUA
- SLACC(Provides all information)
- SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6 server (only provides info of network prefix, prefix length and default gateway address. It does not provide dns addresses and domain name)
- Stateful DHCPv6 (no SLACC) (Only provides the dafault gateway)

  ### Stateless Add Auto Configuration (SLACC)
  - SLACC allows a device to configure a GUA address without the service of DHCPv6
  - The prefix is provided by the RA while the interface id is generated through EUI-64

  ### SLACC with stateless DHCP
  - In this method, a stateless DHCPv6 server is needed to obtain other information such as the DNS server address and a domain name.

  ### Stateful DHCPv6 (NO SLACC)
  - In stateful DHCPv6, it function similar to DHCP in IPv4 as the device requests for an ip address and obtains all the information from the DHCP server. In this case, the DHCPv6 server provides the device with a GUA, prefix length, and the addresses of DNS servers.

## Generating Interface IDs for GUA
  ### EUI-64 Process
  - When an RA message is sent in either SLACC or SLACC with stateless DHCPv6, the client must generate its own interface ID which might cause some redundent addresses.
  - EUI-64 method provides a 64 bit interface ID based on the device's MAC address.
  - To generate a unique interface ID using EUI-64 process, firstly, the**7th bit of the client MAC address is reveresed.** Nextly, it **adds the remaining 16 bits in the middle of the 48 bit MAC address in the form of ff:fe** to **produce a 64 bit interface ID since the MAC address is only 48 bits.**

  ### Randomly generated interface ID

## Subnetting with IPv6
- In IPv4, we use the subnet bits to determine how many subnets we can create but for IPv6, we use the subnet ID.
- The subnet ID field is in between the Global routing prefix and the interface ID
