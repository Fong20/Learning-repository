# 05. Network Layer

## 5.1 Network Layer Protocols

4 functions:
- addresssing end devices
- perform encapsulation (adding ip headers)
- perform routing
- perform de-encapsulation (reading information from the headers)

Common network layer protocols include:
- IP Version 4 (IPV4)
- IP Version 6 (IPV6)

Legacy network layer protocols include:
- Novell internetwork packet exchange (IPX)
- appletalk
- connectionless network service

Other types of network layer protocols:
- Open shortest Path First (OSPF)
- Internet control message protocol (ICMP)
  
Characteristics of IP protocol
- connectionless. No connection is established before sending the data packets. Basically, there is no data exchange prior to data transmission. It is the function of the transport layer to transmit data.

- best effort (unreliable). No overhead is used to guarantee packet delivery. Basically, it does not guarantee that all the packets transmitted will be received. Packets may arrive at the destination corrupted, out of sequence, or not at all. IP provides no capability for packet retransmissions if errors occur.

-  media independent. Ip packets work independently of the medium carrying the data.

### Fragmentation
- One major characteristic of the media that the network layer considers is the maximum size of the PDU that each medium can transport. This characteristic is referred to as the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
- The data link layer passes the MTU value up to the network layer. The network layer then determines how large packets can be.
- An intermediate device, usually a router, must split up an IPv4 packet when forwarding it from one medium to another medium with a smaller MTU. This process is called fragmenting the packet, or fragmentation. Fragmentation causes latency. IPv6 packets cannot be fragmented by the router.

### IPv4

  ### IPv4 packet header
  - Version (4 bits) = IPv4 or IPv6 version
  - Internet header length (4 bits) = length of header
  - Type of service (8 bits) = used for QoS (Quality of Service).
  - Total length (16 bits) = Length of the entire packet (header and data) in bytes. The minimum size is 20 bytes (if you have no data) and the maximum size is 65.535 bytes,
  - Identification (16 bits) = Unique packet ID for identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram
  - Flags (3 bits) = Used for fragmentation (consists of reserved bit, do not fragment and more fragment flag, each consists of 1 bit)
  - Fragment offset (13 bits) = Determines the position of the fragment in the original fragmented IP packet.
  - time to live (8 bits) = Prevents circulation of packet in a loop by limiting the number of hops (Prevents the data from being circulated in the same network too long, the router will drop the data when the TTL reaches 0)
  - Protocol (8 bits) = Tells us which protocol is encapsulated in the packet.
  - Header checksum (16 bits) = Peforms error detection on the header. The receiver can use the checksum to check if there are any errors in the header.
  - Source address (32 bits) = address of the source
  - Destination address (32 bits) = address of the destination

  ### limitations of Ipv4
  - IP address depletion. There are limited number of IP address.
  - Internet routing table expansion. Internet routing table is tougher to expand when the network is scaled up.
  - Lack of end-to-end connectivity

To solve the the limited number of IP address, we use several methods such as the public and private IP address as well as classes

### IPv6
Ipv6 was introduced to sovle the limitations of Ipv4. However, it is still slowly being incorporated as most of our current networks rwork on IPv4/not all network devices support IPv6 yet.

  ### Characteristics of IPv6:
  - Increased address space
  - Improved packet handling
  - Eliminates the need for Network address translation (NAT) which reduces network complexity and netwrk latency.
  - Integrated security

  ### IPv6 packet header
  - Version (4 bits) = version of internet protocol, in this case it is 6 which is 0110
  - Traffic class (8 bits)
  - Flow label (20 bits) = This 20-bit field suggests that all packets with the same flow label receive the same type of handling by routers.
  - Payload length (16 bits)
  - Next header (8 bits)
  - Hop limit (8 bits)
  - Source IP address (128 bits)
  - Destination IP address (128 bits)

### IPv4 vs IPv6 
We use decimal for IPv4 whereas hexadecimals for IPv6

**IPv4 vs IPv6 packet header:**
- In IPv6, there is a new field known as flow label.
- The simplified IPv6 header shown the next figure consists of a fixed length header of 40 octets (largely due to the length of the source and destination IPv6 addresses) whereas the IPv4 header consists of a variable length header of 20 octets (up to 60 bytes if the Options field is used).
- Hop Limit = Time to Live
- Payload Length = Total length
- Traffic class = Type of service. It helps the router to handle the traffic based on the priority of the packet. If congestion occurs on the router then packets with the least priority will be discarded.
- Next header = Protocol. It tells us what protocols are encapsulated in the packet.

## 5.2 Routing
- Hosts must maintain their own routing table to ensure that packets are directed to the correct destination network. Router also uses the routing to execute routing process. the routing table contains direct connection, local network route and local default route.

- Direct connection = Devices which are connected directly to the router.

  ### IPv6 Host Routing table
  **netstat -r** is a command which is used to look at the host routing table.

  ### IPv6 Router routing table
  **show ip route** is a command which is used to look at the router routing table.

###IPv4 address format
  first portion is the network portion (address of the network) while the other half is the host portion (address of the end device).

  - Eg: IPv4 is 192.168.10.024, address of the host is .5 (Note: .1 is reserved for gateways)
  - 192.168.10 is the network portion.
  - .024 is the mask which is used to determine which is the network portion and which is the host portion. .024 means that the first 24 bits are allocated for the network while the rest are allocated for the host.
  - 192.168.10.5 is used to describe the address of the host in the network
