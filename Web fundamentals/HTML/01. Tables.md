# 01. Tables

## What Are HTML Tables?
- HTML tables allow web developers to organize data into rows and columns.
- They are commonly used for displaying structured information, such as schedules, pricing, or comparison charts.

  **Basic Structure of HTML Table:**
- table: The container tag for the entire table.
- tr (table row): Contains table cells.
- th (table header cell): Defines column headers.
- td (table data cell): Contains actual data.

## Table Cells:
Each table cell is defined by a <td> tag (which stands for “table data”).
You can include various content within a cell, such as text, images, lists, links, or even nested tables.

## Table Rows:
Rows start with a <tr> tag (which stands for “table row”). Make sure that the number of cells is consistent across all rows.

## Table Headers:
- To define header cells (for column titles), use the th tag instead of td
- Text inside the header is centered and bold by default

## colspan and rowspan
- colspan is used to merge columns whereas rowspan is used to merge rows together
- Both colspan and rowspan do not have fixed size. The size of the merged columns or rows depend on the size of the content.

**Example 1: colspan**
