# 00. Introduction
What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of directions known as tags which tell the web browser how to display and manage the web document. These tags perform functions such as displaying graphics, formatting text, and referencing hyperlinks.
- HTML is not case sensitive
- Web browsers are needed to run HTML files.

## Elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- It consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.
  
  Note: Not all elements will have an end tag. An example will be the break element

## Components of a HTML file
  
  ### <!DOCTYPE> declaration
  - <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that the document is a HTML document type.
  - It only appears once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
  - The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive

  ### HTML element
  - The HTML element indicates that the document is HTML formatted.
  - The HTML element also indicates the language used in the document. Eg: html lang = 'en' indicates that it is in English language
    
  ### Head element
- The head element contains the head section
- There are two elements in the head section which are the title element and meta element

  ### Title element
- The title element specifies the title of the HTML page which is shown on the browser's page tab.
- It is the first element in the head element
- <title> = start tag, </title> = end tag

  ### Meta element
  - The meta element describes the characteristics of the web page such as the= character encoding of a web page. Character encoding is the internal representation if letters, numbers, and symbols.
  - the meta charset = "utf - 8" defines that the utf-8 character encoding standard is used for the web page.

  ### Body element
- Defines the body of the HTML document, which houses all the contents such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists etc..

## Attributes
- HTML attributes **provide additional information about HTML elements.**
- **Attributes are always specified in the start tag.**
- It is recommended to **use lowercase when declaring attributes** and **quote attribute values.**

  **Examples of attributes**
  - The **href** attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
  - The **src** attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
  - The **width** and **height** attributes of <img> provide size information for images
  - The **alt** attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
  - The **style** attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
  - The **lang** attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
  - The **title** attribute defines some extra information about an element

## Creating Headings
There are 6 levels of heading in HTML with the largest being <h1> tag and the smallest being <h6> tag

## Creating Paragraphs
- In order to create paragraphs, we use the paragraph element.
- Text being type in a paragraph will have an empty space above and below it.

## Create a Line break
- The line break element causes the browser to advance to the next line before displaying the next
element or portion of text on a web page. 
- The line break tag is an empty element which means it does not contain end tags.

## Blockquotes
- Blockquotes are used when we want to insert quotes / contnent which are quoted from another source.
- The text is indented from both left and right margins

## Phrase elements
- Phrase elements **indicate the context and meaning of the text based on the respective element tags.**
- Each browser interprets the style differently

  ### Example of phrase elements

## Lists
Lists are used on web pages to organize information.

There are three types of list
- ordered list
- unordered list
- description list

  ### Ordered lists
  Ordered list uses numbering or lettering system to organize information in a list

    ### Changing attributes of an ordered list
    - We can **change the attributes of ordered list** by using **type, start and reveresed attribute**
    - The type attribute is configures the symbol used for the ordered list
    - The start attribute changes the starting number of the ordered list
    - reveresd attribute (reversed = "reveresed") changes the order from ascending to descending

  ### Unordered list
  - An unordered list uses bullet or shapes to organize information in a list
  - It is the default list type which the browser provides when the author do not provide any list type.

  ### Description list
  - Description list is used to organize terms and their descriptions. Each term begins on its own line at the margin whereas the description begins on its own line with an identation
  - To use description list, we need to start with the dl tag, insert dt tag for the term and insert dd for the description. Each of the tags must contain a start tag and an end tag.

## Inserting special characters 
- In order to use special symbols such as quotation marks, the greater-than sign (>), the less-than sign (<), and the copyright symbol (©) in your web page document, we need to use special characters, sometimes called **entity characters (or HTML entities).**
- To insert special characters, we need to **start with &** and **end with ;**

## Inserting hyperlinks using the anchor element
- To insert a hyperlink, we need to use the **anchor element**
- **href** describes the destination of the hyperlink
- It is a generally a good rule to insert the hyperlink in the anchor tag as well as in the webpage as not everyone

  ### Types of hyperlink
  There are two types of hyperlinks which we can insert by using the anchor element
  - absolute = An absolute hyperlink is **used to link to external webpages.** The **href value
  for an absolute hyperlink to the home page of a website includes the http:// or https:// protocol
  and the domain name.**

  - relative = Relative hyperlink is one that is in relation to where the current HTML document is related. They are useful when you need to link to web pages within your site. The href value for a relative hyperlink does not begin with the http:// or https:// and does not include a domain name but it will contain only the file name, folder or directory of the web page you want to display.

  ### Inserting email hyperlinks
  - An anchor tag is also used to insert email hyperlinks. An email hyperlink will automatically launch the user's default email program when it is clicked with your email address as the recipient.
  - When inserting email hyperlinks, we replace the http:// with mailto:

  Note: It is a good practice to insert the email-address in both the anchor tag as well as on the webpage as it increase usability for the user. This is because not every user will have their email program configured.
  
  ### Target attribute
  When inserting hyperlinks, **use the target attribute to sepcify where to open the hyperlink**

  ### Attribute values

  Example: The **_blank attribute value is used to launch the hyperlink in a new window/tab.** **Launching the hyperlink in either a new window/tab is determined by the settings of the web browser.**

## Structural elements
Structural elements are **used to configure specific areas on a webpage.**

Aithough different websites will have different functionality, content, look and feel, they will generally have the same structural element.
1. Header (or masthead) at the top of the page, usually containing the top level heading of the page, and/or a company logo. This is the big bold statement at the top of the page that
says what the website is and who it belongs to.
2. Main content column, which holds the main content of functionality you are here to use.
3. One or more sidebars, holding peripheral content that is either related to the page’s main
content and changes as new pages are loaded (e.g., related links), or is always relevant
and persists across the whole site (e.g., “shopping cart” information on an e-commerce
site).
4. Navigation menu going across or down the page. This is often put in a sidebar, or may
form part of the header.
5. A footer that goes across the bottom of the page and contains secondary information such
as copyright information and contact details.

**Notable sections:**
- header
- nav
- main
- footer
