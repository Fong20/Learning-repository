## Graphic formats
- PNG format = scales based on pixels
- SVG (scalable vector graphics) format = does not scale based on pixel. Thus, the image quality does not get affected when it resized.

## Inserting images
We can **insert images by using the img tag and src attribute**, The **src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.**

  ### Adjusting the width and height of the image
  - We can change the width and height of the image by specifying the width and height attributes.
  - If we don't specify the width and height of the image, the image will be adjusted to the browser's default image width and height
  - The width and height attributes are specified in pixels.

  ### Alt attribute in images
  - The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

  ### figcaption element
  - The figcaption provides caption for the image
  - In order to add figcaption, we first need to add the figure element

## Inserting multiple graphics into a single image
CSS image sprite is used to insert multiple graphics in a single image

**Example: Inserting three images in a single image name "img_navsprites.gif"**
![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/9779b64d-8d0a-44f4-ae84-a167571fab91)

- img id="home" src="img_trans.gif" sets a small transparent image as the src attribute cannot be empty. The displayed image will be the background image which we specify in CSS.
- width: 46px; height: 44px; defines the portion of the image we want to use.
- background: url(img_navsprites.gif) 0 0; - Defines the background image and its position (left 0px, top 0px)

## Inserting image hyperlinks
- Image hyperlinks allow use to use an image as a link.
- To create an image hyperlink, we need to surround the image element with with anchor tags. By doing this, we are replacing the text that normally sits in between the anchor tags to an image.

  When an image is used as a hyperlink, some browsers show a blue outline at the border of the image by default. To hide the outline, we need to set the border = 0

  ### Image map
  - **Image map allows us to apply multiple clickable or selectable hyperlinks in different areas of the image.**
  - The hyperlinks can be set at a specific area of the image by setting the coordinates of the image. The coordinates of the image can be obtained through a special software.
  - In order to create image map, we need the img element, map element, and area element
 
  **Example: Creating an image map**

  **Step 1: Insert the img element with the usemap attribute**
  
  **The image is inserted using the <img> tag with an additional usemap attribute.** **The usemap attrribute starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map**, and is **used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.**

  **Step 2: Add a map element**
  
  Nextly, add in the map element. The map element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute. In this case, the name of the image map is workmap

  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/a5bcbda6-3c08-4b0b-a410-b125d15990b9)

  **Step 3: Add an area element**

  The area element is added to establish the clickable area.

  **Attrributes of area element**
  1. shape = Defines the shape of the clickable area
  2. coords = Used to provide the coordinates to place the clickable area to the image
  3. alt = used to provide description of the image when the image cannot be displayed
  4. href = Used to insert the hyperlink which will bring the user to the desired webpage.

  The following code sets a clickable area on the image "computer.htm" with the **shape of a rectangle**, with 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top margin on the x-axis, 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top margin on the y-axis

### Inserting background image
- To insert background image, we need to use the background-image property followed by the url
- By default, the background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

**Example:** 

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/8651ea31-2926-4bcc-bb39-4ece722ceea7)

Properties to configure background image:
- background repeat
- background position
- background attachment
- background clip
- background origin
- background size

  ### Background-position
  - The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
  - The background-position can be adjusted either by specifying the postiion, or adjusting the percent.
  - By default, the background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element

    **Values to specify the position of the background-position:**
    - left top
    - left center
    - left bottom
    - right top
    - right center
    - right bottom
    - center top
    - center bottom
 
    **Note: If we only specify one keyword, the other value will be "center"**
    
    **Adjusting the background-position by changing the percentage**
    - x% y%
    - The first value is the horizontal position and the second value is the vertical.
    

  ### Background-repeat
  - The background-repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.
  - By default, the background-image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.
 
    **Background-repeat values:**
    1. repeat =	This is the default value. The background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.  The last image will be clipped if it does not fit.
    2. repeat-x =	The background image is repeated only horizontally
    3. repeat-y =	The background image is repeated only vertically
    4. no-repeat = The background-image is not repeated. The image will only be shown once

  ### Background-attachment
  **The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.**

    ### Background-attachment values
    1. scroll =	This is the default value. The background image will scroll with the page.
    2. fixed =	The background image will not scroll with the page
    3. local =	The background image will scroll with the element's contents
    
  ### Background-clip
  **The background-clip property defines how far the background (color or image) should extend within an element.**

  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/7eb27593-066a-401f-bb7f-d435d3fbca35)

  ### Background-origin 
  The background-origin property specifies the origin position (the background positioning area) of a background image.

  2. border-box =	The background image starts from the upper left corner of the border
  3. content-box =	The background image starts from the upper left corner of the content

  ### Setting rounded corners
  - **The CSS border-radius property defines the radius of an element's corners.**
  - This property can also be applied to background images

  **border-radius values:**
  1. **border radius = Applies rounded corners to all 4 sides of the corner of the element** 
  2. **border-bottom-left-radius = Applies rounded corners to only the bottom left corner of the element**
  3. **border-bottom-right-radius = Applies rounded corners to only the bottom right corner of the element**

    ### border-radius overhead
    The border-radius overhead can be used to specify chracteristics for each corner in one line of code. It can contain from one to four values.
