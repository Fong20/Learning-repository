# 04. Graphics

## Graphic formats
- PNG format = scales based on pixels
- SVG (scalable vector graphics) format = does not scale based on pixel. Thus, the image quality does not get affected when it resized.

## Inserting images
We can **insert images by using the img tag and src attribute**, The **src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.**

  ### Adjusting the width and height of the image
  - We can change the width and height of the image by specifying the width and height attributes.
  - If we don't specify the width and height of the image, the image will be adjusted to the browser's default image width and height
  - The width and height attributes are specified in pixels.

  ### Alt attribute in images
  - The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

  ### figcaption element
  - The figcaption provides caption for the image
  - In order to add figcaption, we first need to add the figure element

## Inserting image hyperlinks
- Image hyperlinks allow use to use an image as a link.
- To create an image hyperlink, we need to surround the image element with with anchor tags. By doing this, we are replacing the text that normally sits in between the anchor tags to an image.

  When an image is used as a hyperlink, some browsers show a blue outline at the border of the image by default. To hide the outline, we need to set the border = 0

### Inserting background image
- To insert background image, we need to use the background-image property followed by the url
- By default, the background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

**Example:**

Properties to configure background image:
- background repeat
- background position
- background attachment
- background clip
- background origin
- background size

  ### Background-repeat
  - The background-repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.
  - By default, a background-image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.
 
    **Background-repeat values:**
    1. repeat =	This is the default value. The background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.  The last image will be clipped if it does not fit.
    2. repeat-x =	The background image is repeated only horizontally
    3. repeat-y =	The background image is repeated only vertically
    4. no-repeat = The background-image is not repeated. The image will only be shown once
