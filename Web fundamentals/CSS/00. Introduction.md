# 00. Introdution
Cascading style sheets (CSS) is used to describe / style the presentation of a HTML document.

## Types of style sheet
There are three types of style sheet assiociated with a HTML document
- User agent (Browser style sheet)
- User style sheet
- Author style sheet

### User agent style sheets
- A user agent is **any software that retrieves and presents Web content for end users or is implemented using Web technologies that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with Web
content.** In most cases, the **user agent will typically be the web browser.**
- The browser will apply style sheets to all web documents (Eg: black text, blue links, purple links for visited sites etc)
- However, once **we apply a style sheet to a document**, it will **override the browser's style sheet as an author style sheet will always override a browser's stlye sheet.**

### User style sheets
- User style sheets are set by the user within their own web browser.
- These style sheets will override the browser's default stylesheets for that user only.

### Author style sheets
- Author style sheets are **style sheets which are applied by us, authors who develops the website.**
- Everything we do to change the visual of the document, from choosing fonts, colours and laying out pages in CSS is done using author style sheets.
- Author style sheets can be **applied inside an HTML document** or by **linking to an external file.**

### Style sheet precedence
The following CSS declarations are applied in this order (from lowest to highest priority):
- user agent stylle sheet (web browser style sheet)
- user style sheet normal
- author style sheet normal
- author style sheet important
- user style sheet important

Note: Without the usage of !importnant declaration, the order goes like this (author to user to browser style)

## CSS selectors and declarations
CSS is **composed of style rules that describe the styling to be applied to the HTML document.** Each rule consists of two parts which are:
- **selector** = HTML element name, class name or an id name
- **declaration** = CSS styling property and the value which is assigned to the property.

**Example:**

## Inserting style sheets
There are generally five ways of inserting style sheets
- Embedded
- Inline
- External
- class selector
- id selector

  ### Embedded
  - The CSS style is **defined within the style element in the head section of a web page**
  - The style applies to the element which u have specified as the selector
  - If we specify the body element as the selector, then it will apply the CSS style to all the contents in the body element.
  - One major advantage of implementing embedded styles is it is more efficient. Embedded styles are **coded in the header section only once and the styling will be applied to all the entire page.** This practice is more efficient than using inline styles to code individual styles on HTML elements.

  ### Inline
  - It is **found in the body section of the HTML document**
  - When we insert inline style sheets, the **styling only applies to a specific element as inline Style sheets are inserted as an attribute of the element.**

  ### External
  - All the **styling codes are stored in a separate file wth .css file extension.**
  - It can be **applied to the HTML file by using the HTML link element in the head section of the HTML file.** The styling applies to all webpages as long as it is linked to the css file.

  ### Class selector
  CSS class selector is used to apply styling to certain elements on a web page and not necessarily ti the style to a
  particular HTML element.

    ### Declaring a class selector
    - When setting a style for a class, **place a dot, or period (.), followed by the class name**
    - A class name must begin with a letter and may contain numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Class names may not contain spaces and # as # represents the syntax for id selector.

  ### Id selector
  - The id selector function simillar to the class selector. However, unlike a class selector which can be applied multiple
times on a web page, an id may only be applied once per web page.
  - If we want to use multiple id selectors, we need to declare multiple id selectors.
    
 
    ### Declaring an id selector
    - When setting a style for an id, place a hash mark (#) in front of the id name in the style sheet.
    - An id name may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Id names may not contain spaces.

    Note: **When class selectors and id selectors are applied to the same element, the style of the id selectors will overide the class selectors** as **Id selectors have the higher specificity.**
