# 00. Introdution
Cascading style sheets (CSS) is used to describe / style the presentation of a HTML document.

## Types of style sheet
There are three types of style sheet assiociated with a HTML document
- User agent (Browser style sheet)
- User style sheet
- Author style sheet

### User agent style sheets
- A user agent is **any software that retrieves and presents Web content for end users or is implemented using Web technologies that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with Web
content.** In most cases, the **user agent will typically be the web browser.**
- The browser will apply style sheets to all web documents (Eg: black text, blue links, purple links for visited sites etc)
- However, once **we apply a style sheet to a document**, it will **override the browser's style sheet as an author style sheet will always override a browser's stlye sheet.**

### User style sheets
- User style sheets are set by the user within their own web browser.
- These style sheets will override the browser's default stylesheets for that user only.

### Author style sheets
- Author style sheets are **style sheets which are applied by us, authors who develops the website.**
- Everything we do to change the visual of the document, from choosing fonts, colours and laying out pages in CSS is done using author style sheets.
- Author style sheets can be **applied inside an HTML document** or by **linking to an external file.**

### Style sheet precedence
The following CSS declarations are applied in this order (from lowest to highest priority):
- user agent stylle sheet (web browser style sheet)
- user style sheet normal
- author style sheet normal
- author style sheet important
- user style sheet important

Note: Without the usage of !importnant declaration, the order goes like this (author to user to browser style)

## CSS selectors and declarations
CSS is **composed of style rules that describe the styling to be applied to the HTML document.** Each rule consists of two parts which are:
- **selector** = HTML element name which we want to apply to the element, class name or an id name
- **declaration** = CSS styling property and the value which is assigned to the property.

**Example:**

  ### CSS Grouping selectors
  - If we want to apply the same styling properties to different elements, we can use the CSS grouping selector to group all the HTML elements with the same style definitions instead of typing individual selectors and declarations. This minimizes the number of code.
  - To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

  The following code applies the same styling properties to multiple elements using CSS grouping selectors, the code is much simpler and shorter

## Inserting style sheets
There are generally five ways of inserting style sheets
- Embedded
- Inline
- External
- class selector
- id selector

  ### Embedded
  - The CSS style is **defined within the style element in the head section of a web page**
  - The style applies to the element which u have specified as the selector
  - If we specify the body element as the selector, then it will apply the CSS style to all the contents in the body element.
  - One major advantage of implementing embedded styles is it is more efficient. Embedded styles are **coded in the header section only once and the styling will be applied to all the entire page.** This practice is more efficient than using inline styles to code individual styles on HTML elements.

  ### Inline
  - It is **found in the body section of the HTML document**
  - When we insert inline style sheets, the **styling only applies to a specific element as inline Style sheets are inserted as an attribute of the element.**
  - **Inline style has the highest priority.** **It will always override the external style, embedded style and inline style when it is applied to the same element.**

  ### External
  - For external style CSS, **all the CSS styling codes are stored in a separate file wth .css file extension.** The external style sheet file does not contain any HTML tags; it contains only CSS style rules.
  - It can be **applied to the HTML file by using the HTML link element in the head section of the HTML file.** The styling applies to all webpages as long as it is linked to the css file.
  - Thus, this approach allows us to apply the same styling to multiple web pages.

  **External CSS file named format_styles**

  Note: When we specify specific style for an element (Eg: style for the paragraph tag, it will overide the paragraph style element in the body element)

  ### Class selector
  **CSS class selector is used to apply styling to certain elements on a web page** and not necessarily to the style to a
  particular HTML element.

    ### Declaring a class selector
    - When setting a style for a class, **place a dot, or period (.), followed by the class name**
    - A class name must begin with a letter and may contain numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Class names may not contain spaces and # as # represents the syntax for id selector.

  ### Id selector
  - The id selector function simillar to the class selector. However, **unlike a class selector which can be applied multiple
times on a web page, an id may only be applied once per web page.**
  - If we want to use multiple id selectors, we need to declare multiple id selectors.
    
    ### Declaring an id selector
    - When setting a style for an id, **place a hash mark (#) in front of the id name in the style sheet.**
    - An id name may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Id names may not contain spaces.

    Note: **When class selectors and id selectors are applied to the same element, the style of the id selectors will overide the class selectors** as **Id selectors have the higher specificity.**

  ### CSS Descendant
  - A CSS descendant selector is **used to apply a style to the child element within the parent element.**
  - By using CSS descendants, it reduces the number of different classes and ids needed but still allows us to
configure CSS for specific areas on the web page.
  - CSS descendent is applied by using the section element
 
    **The following code applies red text color to the paragraph element in the parent element body**

  ### CSS Span
  The span element is used to format a specific area which is contained within another, such as within a paragraph tag, blockquote tag, list tag or div tag
