# 05. CSS Layouts

## Normal flow
Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

## Element display type

1. Block elements:
- respect all margins and padding
- force a line break after the block element
- does not allow other elements to their left and right
- acquires full-width if width not defined (i.e. by default)
  
2. Inline elements:
- respect left and right margins and padding, but not top and bottom
- cannot have a width and height set
- allow other elements to sit to their left and right
  
3. Inline-block elements:
- placed like an inline but behaves like a block
- allows other elements to sit to their left and right
- respect top and bottom margins and padding
- respect height and width

## CSS Float
- The float property is used to wrap text around images.
- The default CSS float value is none

There are a few values of the float property:
1. left = The element floats to the left of the container
2. right = The element floats to the right of the container
3. none = The element does not float ( It will be displayed where it occurs in the text)
4. inherit = The element inherits the float value of its parent

**Example: No float is applied to the image**

If the value of float is none, the image will be displayed at just where it occurs in the text.

**Example: Floating an image to the right**

**Example: Applying float next to each other**

Applying float: left to multiple elements will cause the float to displayed next to each other

### CSS Clear
The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

Values of clear property
1. none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
2. left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
3. right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
4. both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
5. inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent
