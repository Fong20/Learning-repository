# 05. CSS Layouts

## Normal flow
Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

## Element display type

1. Block elements:
- respect all margins and padding
- force a line break after the block element
- does not allow other elements to their left and right
- acquires full-width if width not defined (i.e. by default)
  
2. Inline elements:
- respect left and right margins and padding, but not top and bottom
- cannot have a width and height set
- allow other elements to sit to their left and right
  
3. Inline-block elements:
- placed like an inline but behaves like a block
- allows other elements to sit to their left and right
- respect top and bottom margins and padding
- respect height and width

## CSS Float
- The float property is used to wrap text around images.
- The default CSS float value is none

There are a few values of the float property:
1. left = The element floats to the left of the container
2. right = The element floats to the right of the container
3. none = The element does not float ( It will be displayed where it occurs in the text)
4. inherit = The element inherits the float value of its parent

**Example: No float is applied to the image**

If the value of float is none, the image will be displayed at just where it occurs in the text.

**Example: Floating an image to the right**

**Example: Applying float next to each other**

Applying float: left to multiple elements will cause the float to displayed next to each other

### CSS Clear
- **The clear property specifies where to position the element which is next to a floating element.**
- **When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float.** If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

**Values of clear property**
1. none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default clear property value
2. left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
3. right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
4. both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
5. inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

**Example:** 

With the clear: left; property implemented, it pushes the div4 element down below the left floating div3

### CSS Overflow
- **CSS Overflow property is used to configure how content should display when it is too big to fit into an area.**
- If the content is smaller than the size of the content area of the containing box, the content will appear as is.
- If the content is larger than the size of the content area of the containing box, the contents will overflow into the next element.
- **The overflow property only works for block elements in which the height is set**

**Values of overflow property**
1. visible - This is the default option. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
2. hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
3. scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
4. auto - It functions similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

**Example 1: overflow: visible**

When overflow is set to visible, the content is not clipped and exceeds the area.

**Example 2: overflow: hidden**

When overflow is set to hidden, the content which exceeds the area is clipped and hidden:

When overflow is set to scroll, the content is clipped and a scrollbar is added horizontally and vertically to scroll the content inside the area.
