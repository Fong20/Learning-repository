# Introdution
Cascading style sheets (CSS) is used to describe / style the presentation of a HTML document.

## Types of style sheet
There are three types of style sheet assiociated with a HTML document
- User agent (Browser style sheet)
- User style sheet
- Author style sheet

### User agent style sheets
- A user agent is **any software that retrieves and presents Web content for end users or is implemented using Web technologies that help in retrieving, rendering and interacting with Web
content.** In most cases, the **user agent will typically be the web browser.**
- The browser will apply style sheets to all web documents (Eg: black text, blue links, purple links for visited sites etc)
- However, once **we apply a style sheet to a document**, it will **override the browser's style sheet as an author style sheet will always override a browser's stlye sheet.**

### User style sheets
- User style sheets are set by the user within their own web browser.
- These style sheets will override the browser's default stylesheets for that user only.

### Author style sheets
- Author style sheets are **style sheets which are applied by us, authors who develops the website.**
- Everything we do to change the visual of the document, from choosing fonts, colours and laying out pages in CSS is done using author style sheets.
- Author style sheets can be **applied inside an HTML document** or by **linking to an external file.**
