# 06. Flexbox

What is Flexbox?
- Flexbox, short for “Flexible Box Layout,” is a CSS layout model that simplifies creating complex layouts. It provides a flexible way to align elements and distribute space within a container element.
- The Flexbox layout model is bidirectional, meaning you can arrange elements in rows, columns, or both.

## Main elements of a flexbox:
1. Flex Container: The parent element that holds the flex items.
2. Flex Items: The children elements within the flex container.

The elements are laid out as flexible boxes, they are laid out along two axes
1. Main Axis: The primary direction along which flex items are placed.
2. Cross Axis: The axis which is perpendicular to the direction of the main axis.

### Flex container (flexible container)
- An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container.
- To create a flex container, we need to type in display: flex in the parent element. Once that is done, the child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.

**There are several properties of the flex container**
1. flex-direction = Establishes the main axis direction (row, column, etc.).
2. flex-wrap = Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines.
3. flex-flow = Shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.
4. justify-content = sets the position of the flex items along the main axis
5. align-items = sets the position of the flex items along the cross axis
6. align-content = sets the spacing multiple rows of flex items

  ### flex-direction
  The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container stacks the flex items.

  **Values of flex-direction:**
  1. column = the flex-items are stacked vertically from top to bottom
  2. column-reverse = the flex-items are stacked vertically from bottom to top
  3. row = the flex-items are stack horizontally from left to right 
  4. row-reverse = the flex-items are stacked horizontally from right to left

  **Example 1: flex-direction set to column**   
  
  When flex-direction is set to column, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal

  **Example 2: flex-direction set to column-reverse**

  **Example 3: flex-direction set to row**

   When flex-direction is set to row, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical

  **Example 4: flex-direction set to row-reverse**

  ### flex-wrap
  - The flex-wrap property controls whether the flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or remain on a single line.
  - **It affects how the flexible items within a flex container are arranged when there’s not enough space to fit them all in a single row or column.**

  **Values for flex-wrap:**
  1. nowrap (Default): Flexible items won’t wrap. They’ll stay in a single line.
  2. wrap: Flexible items will wrap onto multiple lines if necessary.
  3. wrap-reverse: functions similar to wrap, but wraps in reverse order (last item becomes the first).

  **flex-wrap set to nowrap**

  ### flex-flow
  The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties. It starts with flex-direction peoperty followed by the flex-wrap property.

  **Example:**

  **flex-flow: row-wrap; sets the flex-direction to row and flex-wrap to wrap**
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/adbf9b77-5d85-4a38-9ae6-473d17f8538b)

  ### justify-content
  **The justify-content property determines how the browser distributes space around flex elements along the container’s main axis.**

  **Values for justify-content:**
  1. center: Packs items around the center of the alignment container along the main axis.
  2. start (or flex-start): Packs items from the start edge of the alignment container.
  3. end (or flex-end): Packs items from the end edge of the alignment container.
  4. space-between: Distributes flex-items evenly with gaps in between flex-items. 
  5. space-around: Distributes items evenly, with gaps between items. Start and end gaps are half the size of the space between each item.
  6. space-evenly: Distributes items evenly, with equal-sized gaps at the start, in-between, and end.
  7. stretch: Distributes items evenly and stretches ‘auto’-sized items to fit the container.

  **Example 1: justify-content set to center**

  ### align-items
  - CSS align-items is used to adjust the layout of the elements for the cross-axis
  - For align-items to work,  more height is required in the flex-container to display the items. It then works on all the items as a set, and dictates what happens with that free space, and the alignment of the entire set of items within it.

  **Values for align-items**
  1. align-items: flex-start
  2. align-content: flex-end
  3. align-content: center
  4. align-content: space-between
  5. align-content: space-around
  6. align-content: stretch

  **Example 1: align-items set to center**

  When align-items is set to center, the flex items are positioned at the center of the flex-container.

  **Example 2: align-items set to flex-start**
  
  When align-items is set to flex-start, the flex items are positioned at the top of the flex-container.

  **Example 3: align-items set to flex-end**
  
  When align-items is set to flex-end, the flex items are positioned at the bottom of the flex-container.

  ### Flex-items
- Flex items are the direct children of a flex container.
- Flex items are arranged and aligned based on the properties of the flexbox container.

**Properties for Flex Items:**
1. order: specifies the order of the flex items.
2. flex-grow: Determines how much a flex-item grows relative to other items.
3. flex-shrink: Controls how much a flex-item shrinks when there’s insufficient space.
4. flex-basis: Sets the initial size of a flex-item before any remaining space is distributed.
5. align-self: Overrides the alignment set by justify-content for individual items.

  ### order property
  **CSS order property specifies the order of the flex items.** This is ideal when we do not want the first flex item in the to appear as the first item in the layout.

  **Example:**
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/1b1d535c-ed1c-4be9-b3a1-ca528be315b0)

  ### flex-basis
  **CSS flex-basis adjusts the width of the flex-item.**

  **Example:** 
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/6b7f1643-d024-48d5-b2af-1aa755fa41b1)

  ### flex-grow
  - **The flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.**
  - The value must be a number and the default value is 0.

  **Example:** 

  The following code sets the third flex item to grow eight times larger than the other flex items
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/5c2c0809-d91e-4dc2-b11d-734665c86183)

  ### flex-shrink
  **The flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.**

  **Example:**

  The following code do not let the third flex item to shrink
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/47e15e5d-547a-4b32-98c3-4d9aae3d0e8f)

  ### flex 
  **The CSS flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.**

  **Example:**

  The following code sets the third flex item to be not growable (0), not shrinkable (0), and with an initial length of 200 pixels
