# 06. Flexbox

What is Flexbox?
- Flexbox, short for “Flexible Box Layout,” is a CSS layout model that simplifies creating complex layouts. It provides a flexible way to align elements and distribute space within a container element.
- The Flexbox layout model is bidirectional, meaning you can arrange elements in rows, columns, or both.

## Main elements of a flexbox:
1. Flex Container: The parent element that holds the flex items.
2. Flex Items: The children elements within the flex container.

The elements are laid out as flexible boxes, they are laid out along two axes
1. Main Axis: The primary direction along which flex items are placed.
2. Cross Axis: The axis which is perpendicular to the direction of the main axis.

### Flex container (flexible container)
- An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container.
- To create a flex container, we need to type in display: flex in the parent element. Once that is done, the child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.

**There are several properties of the flex container**
1. flex-direction = Establishes the main axis direction (row, column, etc.).
2. flex-wrap = Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines.
3. flex-flow = Shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.
4. justify-content
5. align-items
6. align-content

  ### flex-direction
  The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container stacks the flex items.

  **Values of flex-direction:**
  1. column = the flex-items are stacked vertically from top to bottom
  2. column-reverse = the flex-items are stacked vertically from bottom to top
  3. row = the flex-items are stack horizontally from left to right 
  4. row-reverse = the flex-items are stacked horizontally from right to left

  **Example 1: flex-direction set to column**   
  
  When flex-direction is set to column, the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal

  **Example 2: flex-direction set to column-reverse**

  **Example 3: flex-direction set to row**

   When flex-direction is set to row, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical

  **Example 4: flex-direction set to row-reverse**

  ### flex-wrap
  - The flex-wrap property controls whether the flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or remain on a single line.
  - **It affects how the flexible items within a flex container are arranged when there’s not enough space to fit them all in a single row or column.**

  **Values for flex-wrap:**
  1. nowrap (Default): Flexible items won’t wrap. They’ll stay in a single line.
  2. wrap: Flexible items will wrap onto multiple lines if necessary.
  3. wrap-reverse: functions similar to wrap, but wraps in reverse order (last item becomes the first).

  **flex-wrap set to nowrap**

  ### flex-flow
  The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

  Example:

  **flex-flow: row-wrap; sets the flex-direction to row and flex-wrap to wrap**

  ### justify-content
  The justify-content property determines how the browser distributes space around flex elements along the container’s main axis.

  **Values for justify-content:**
  1. center: Packs items around the center of the alignment container along the main axis.
  2. start (or flex-start): Packs items from the start edge of the alignment container.
  3. end (or flex-end): Packs items from the end edge of the alignment container.
  4. space-between: Distributes flex-items evenly with gaps in between flex-items. 
  5. space-around: Distributes items evenly, with gaps between items. Start and end gaps are half the size of the space between each item.
  6. space-evenly: Distributes items evenly, with equal-sized gaps at the start, in-between, and end.
  7. stretch: Distributes items evenly and stretches ‘auto’-sized items to fit the container.

  ### align-items
  CSS align-items is used to adjust the layout of the elements for the cross-axis

  ### Flex-items
- Flex items are the direct children of a flex container.
- Flex items are arranged and aligned based on the properties of the flexbox container.

**Properties for Flex Items:**
1. flex-grow: Determines how much a flex-item grows relative to other items.
2. flex-shrink: Controls how much a flex-item shrinks when there’s insufficient space.
3. flex-basis: Sets the initial size of a flex-item before any remaining space is distributed.
4. align-self: Overrides the alignment set by justify-content for individual items.

  ### flex-basis
  CSS flex-basis adjusts the width of the flex-item
  
Alignment and Distribution:
justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., flex-start, center, space-between).
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (e.g., flex-start, center, stretch).
align-content: Controls space distribution when there’s extra space (e.g., space-between).
