# 01. Formatting colors

## Specifiying color in CSS
There are several ways to specify colors in CSS:
- Hexadecimal colors 
- RGB colors
- RGBA colors
- HSL colors
- HSLA colors
- Predifined/Cross-browser color names

  ### Hexadecimal colors
  - Hexadecimal color codes **begin with a # followed by 6 hex digits ranging from 00 to FF (0 to 255 in base 10)**
  - The # symbol signifies that the value is hexadecimal. You can use either uppercase or lowercase letters in hexadecimal color values; ( Eg: #FF0000 and #ff0000 both configure
the color red.)
  - The following 6 hex digits represent a 24-bit value for colour (8-bits for each red, green and blue
primary additive colours), broken down as #RRGGBB.

  ### RGB colors
  - RGB **specifies the intensity of each of the red, green and blue colour components.**
  - It is specified in decimal values from 0 to 255, representing an 8-bit value with 256 different intensity values.
  - 0 = no intensity
  - 255 = maximum intensity

    ### RGBA
    - The RGBA version **has an additional Alpha (A) channel with values that range from 0.0 to 1.0 that allows you to control the opacity of the colour.
    - 0 = fully transparent
    - 1 = fully opaque

  ### HSL colors
  - HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness
  - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
  - Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color.
  - Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is black, 100% is white.

  ### HSLA
  - The HSLA version has an additional Alpha (A) channel with values that range from 0.0 to 1.0 that allows you to control the opacity of the colour.
  - 0 = fully transparent
  - 1 = fully opaque

  ### Color names
  Color names are not case sensitive

  **Hexadecimal and RGB information for color names**

## Text and background color
- To change the text and background color, we need to provide the selector and declaration with the color/background-color property and the hexa/rgb values for the color.
- The color property is used to change the text color.
- The background-color property is used to change the background color.
  
  ### Example 1: Backgrond-color property
  The background-color property is used to apply DodgerBlue background color to the heading 1 element and Tomato background color to the paragraph element

  ### Example 2: Color property
  The color property is used to apply Tomato text color to the heading 3 element, DodgerBlue text color to the first paragraph element and MediumSeaGreen text color to the second paragraph element.
