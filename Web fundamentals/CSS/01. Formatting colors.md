# 01. Formatting colors

## Specifiying color in CSS
There are several ways to specify colors in CSS:
- Hexadecimal colors 
- RGB colors
- RGBA colors
- HSL colors
- HSLA colors
- Predifined/Cross-browser color names

  ### Hexadecimal colors
  - Hexadecimal color codes begin with a # followed by 6 hex digits ranging from 00 to FF (0 to 255 in base 10)
  - The # symbol signifies that the value is hexadecimal. You can use either uppercase or lowercase letters in hexadecimal color values; ( Eg: #FF0000 and #ff0000 both configure
the color red.)
  - The following 6 hex digits represent a 24-bit value for colour (8-bits for each red, green and blue
primary additive colours), broken down as #RRGGBB.

  ### RGB colors
  - RGB specifies the intensity of each of the red, green and blue colour components.
  - It is specified in decimal values from 0 to 255, representing an 8-bit value with 256
different intensity values. 0!no intensity, 255!maximum intensity.
  - The RGBA version has an additional Alpha (A) channel with values that range from 0.0 to 1.0 that allows you to control the opacity of the colour. 0 = fully transparent, 1 =fully
opaque.

  ### HSL colors
  - HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness
  - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
  - Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color.
  - Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is black, 100% is white.
  - The HSLA version has an additional Alpha (A) channel with values that range from 0.0 to 1.0 that allows you to control the opacity of the colour. 0!fully transparent, 1!fully
opaque.

  ### Color names
  Color names are not case sensitive

## Text and background color
To change the text and background color, we need to provide the selector and declaration with the color property and the hexa/rgb values for the color.
