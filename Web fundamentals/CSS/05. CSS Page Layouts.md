# 05. CSS Layouts

## Normal flow
**Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.**

## Element display type

1. Block elements:
- respect all margins and padding
- force a line break after the block element
- does not allow other elements to their left and right
- acquires full-width if width not defined (i.e. by default)
  
2. Inline elements:
- respect left and right margins and padding, but not top and bottom
- cannot have a width and height set
- allow other elements to sit to their left and right
  
3. Inline-block elements:
- placed like an inline but behaves like a block
- allows other elements to sit to their left and right
- respect top and bottom margins and padding
- respect height and width

## CSS width and height
- The CSS width property is used to set the width of an element's content.
- The CSS height properties is used to set the height of an element's content.
- The CSS width and height properties only configures the width and height of the element's content, it does not include padding, borders, or margins!

**Units of CSS width and height property:**
1. auto = This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
2. px = sets the width or height in fixed pixels
3. em = sets the width or height relative to the parent element's font size
4. % - sets the width or height relative to the parent element
5. vw = sets the width relative to the browser's window size (viewport)
6. vh = sets the height relative to the browser's window size (viewport)
  
px is an absolute unit whereas em, %, vw and vh are relative units.

**Example:**

   ### CSS max-width
   - **The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element's content in the browser's viewport.** It prevents the value of the width property from becoming larger than max-width.
   - Not only that, **it also reduces the possibility of text stretching across large expanses of the screen by a high resolution monitor.**
   - The max-width can be specified with the same length units, such as px, cm, percent (%) of the parent's element, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).
   - If the content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the height of the element whereas if the content is smaller than the maximum width, the max-width property has no effect.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/fd15b794-2abe-4822-91ed-225ee9d6ffc5)

  **Note:  If the width property and the max-width property are both used on the same element, and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will override the width property.**

  ### CSS min-width
  - **The min-width property defines the minimum width of an element's content in the browser's viewport.** It prevents the value of the width property from becoming smaller than min-width.
  - Not only that, **it also prevents the content from jumping around when a browser is resized.** **Scrollbars appear if the browser viewport is resized below the minimum width.**
  - The min-width can be specified with the same length units, such as px, cm, percent (%) of the parent's element, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).
  - If the content is smaller than the minimum width, the minimum width will be applied whereas if the content is larger than the minimum width, the min-width property has no effect.

**Example:**

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/c9c0f12f-1ac0-439e-a148-74325a72387a)

## CSS Box sizing
- The box-sizing property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated such as should they include padding and borders, or not.
- Whenever we set the width and height, it only applies to the element's content. The element often appears bigger than we have set as the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height. However, CSS box-sizing property allows us to set the actual width of an element which includes both the padding and border in the element's total width and height.

actual width of an element = content width + padding width + border width
actual height of an element = content height + padding height + border height

**Values of CSS box-sizing property:**
1. content-box = This is the default value. The width and height properties (and min/max properties) is only applied to the content. Border and padding are not included.
2. border-box = The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border

**Example 1: Without CSS box-sizing property**

Without box-sizing property, the padding is added to the width of the element, thus making it look bigger than what we have set.

**Example 2: With CSS box-sizing property**
The box-sizing property with the border-box value is used to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

## CSS Position
The CSS position property defines how an element is positioned within its containing element. 

**There are five values for the position property:**
- static
- relative
- fixed
- absolute
- sticky

The values for the position property include top, left, right and bottom

  ### static
  Elements which are set to static position are are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. They are positioned according to the normal flow of the page (default behavior).

  ### relative
  - **Elements are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.**
  - Adjusting top, bottom, left, or right properties shifts the element from its original position.
  - Other content does not adjust to fill gaps which are left by the relatively positioned element.

  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/7cdaa8cb-e064-4008-a045-f3ecc57d1ef4)

  ### fixed
  - Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (browser window).
  - It remains fixed even when the page is scrolled which is ideal to be used for navigation headers or footers.
  - No gap is left in the page where the fixed element would have been located.

  ### absolute
  Elements are positioned relative to the nearest ancestor postion. However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
  Removed from the normal flow, allowing overlap with other elements.
  Useful for creating overlays, tooltips, or modals.

  **Example of the difference between relative and absolute positioning**
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/ed1a9582-e0e2-4e02-8d28-9ddc58c803cb)

  ### sticky
  Elements which use sticky position are positioned based on the userâ€™s scroll position.
  Toggles between relative and fixed positioning.
  Stays in place until a specific scroll threshold is reached.

## CSS z-index
- **When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.cThe z index property provides a way to configure the stacking of positioned elements on a web page. (which element to be placed in front or behind)**
- The z-index property values are in integer
- A positive integer will place the element at the front position whereas a negative integer will place the element at the rear position

**Example 1: positive z-index value vs negative z-index value**

Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.
![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/0be2b4cf-f3a8-44db-8181-835a913df72d)

**Example 2: multiple elements with different z-index values**

An element with greater z-index value is always above an element with a lower z-index value:
![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/869f01a5-3c60-4e81-83d0-370cd48ebb5b)

**Example 3: Without z-index**
If two positioned elements overlap each other without a z-index specified, the element defined last in the HTML code will be shown on top.

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/c51c0df7-2c9d-49f5-93e8-f32ddcd65c50)

**Note: The z-index property only works on positioned elements and flex-items.**

## CSS Float
- The float property is used to wrap text around images.
- The default CSS float value is none

There are a few values of the float property:
1. left = The element floats to the left of the container
2. right = The element floats to the right of the container
3. none = The element does not float ( It will be displayed where it occurs in the text)
4. inherit = The element inherits the float value of its parent

**Example: No float is applied to the image**

If the value of float is none, the image will be displayed at just where it occurs in the text.

**Example: Floating an image to the right**

**Example: Applying float next to each other**

Applying float: left to multiple elements will cause the float to displayed next to each other

### CSS Clear
- **The clear property specifies where to position the element which is next to a floating element.**
- **When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float.** If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

**Values of clear property**
1. none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default clear property value
2. left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
3. right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
4. both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
5. inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

**Example:** 

With the clear: left; property implemented, it pushes the div4 element down below the left floating div3

### CSS Overflow
- **CSS Overflow property is used to configure how content should display when it is too big to fit into an area.**
- If the content is smaller than the size of the content area of the containing box, the content will appear as is.
- If the content is larger than the size of the content area of the containing box, the contents will overflow into the next element.
- **The overflow property only works for block elements in which the height is set**

**Values of overflow property**
1. visible - This is the default option. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
2. hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
3. scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
4. auto - It functions similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

**Example 1: overflow: visible**

When overflow is set to visible, the content is not clipped and exceeds the area.

**Example 2: overflow: hidden**

When overflow is set to hidden, the content which exceeds the area is clipped and hidden:

**Example 3: overflow: scroll**

When overflow is set to scroll, the content is clipped and a scrollbar is added horizontally and vertically to scroll the content inside the area.

**Example 4: overflow: auto**

When overflow is set to auto, it function similar to scroll but it will only add scrollbars only when necessary

## CSS @media
- The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.
- It is also used to specify that certain styles are only for printed documents or for screen readers (mediatype: print, screen, or speech).
- The media rule can be applied in both embedded CSS and external CSS.

**Syntax:**
