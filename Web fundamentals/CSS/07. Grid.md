  ### grid-container-columns

  - Each of the value of the grid-container-columns property is separated by a space, where each value defines the width of the respective column.
  
  **Example 1: Create 4 columns and set the width of each column to auto**
  
  The following code creates 4 columns with each of the width of the column set to auto
