## File size
L = 2^k

Calculating the number of bits required to store the image

b = M x N x k

## Point operation
- Defined as mathematical operations conducted on individual pixel values
- Mathematical operations include arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- addition and subtraction affects the brightness of an image while multiplication and division affects the contrast of an image
- It does not depend on the values of pixel neighbours
- Point operation can be conducted on a single image as well as multiple images
- The effects affects the whole image

**Formula:**
s = T(r), where

- s represents the processed image pixel value
- T represenats the transformational function
- r represents the original pixel value

### Arithmetic operation on single image
Each pixel of the image is operated upon by a constant, C

### Arithmetic operation on multiple images
- Multiple source images can be added, multiplied, subtracted, and divided by the other to provide a new image (output)
- Point processing operation of two images can only occur when two images have the same amount of rows and columns

#### Addition image operation
The addition operation between two images produces a brighter image

#### Complications of arithmetic image operations
There are two complications associated to arithmetic image operations

**Color depth**
- The addition of two 8 bit greyscale images will result to a pixel value of above 255, which exceeds the color depth of either source
- This can be solved by performing **truncation**, where the intensity values are capped at 255 if the values exceeds 255 as well as performing **rescaling**
- Rescaling fixes the issue by finding the maximum value of the image (imax) and divide each of the image pixel values by the maximum value of the image (imax) and multiply it by 255
- However, the process of truncation and rescaling is only done at the very last stage of the processing, that is when the image is to be saved into a proper image file for display purposes in order to minimize information loss

**Example:**

Largest value = 380, rescaling is done by dividing each value by 380 and multiplying with 255

#### Subtraction image operation
The subtraction operation between two images produces a darker image

#### Multiplication image operation
The multiplication operation between two images produce a higher contrast image

#### Division image operation
The division operation between two images produce a lower contrast image

## Logical image operation
There are three logical image operations, which are logical and, logical or, and logical xor

### Logical AND image operation
- In logical AND operation, a mask needs to be defined
- mask = segmentation / region of interest (area which is to be focussed on)
- The region of interest is defined by using the value of 255 while the region which we want to remove (do not focus on) is done by using the value of 0
- If the image is an 8-bit grayscale image, Any value which AND with 255 will remain back the same value while any value which AND with 0 will become 0

## Regional Contrast Adjustment
Refers to the adjustment of contrast in only certain parts of an image

three methods:
- logarithmic
- exponential
- power law

### Logarithmic transform
- Enhance details in the dark regions at the expense of detail in the bright regions.
- increases dynamic range in dark region
- decreases dynamic range in bright regions

### Exponential transform
- increases dynamic range in bright region
- decreases dynamic range in dark regions

### Power Law transform
- Known as the combination of logarithmic and exponential transform
- maps a narrow range of input values into a wider range or output values

##  Bit-plane slicing
- Defined as the technique to determine the visual information of an individual pixel bit of an image
- Higher-order bits usually contain most of the significant visual information (refers to binary system).
- Lower-order bits contain subtle details.
