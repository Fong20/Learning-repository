# 02. Pixel Value Manipulation

## File size
L = 2^k

Calculating the number of bits required to store the image

b = M x N x k

## Point processing operation
- transforms a pixel's value as function of its value alone
- The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is part of point processing operation
- The effects affects the whole image

**Formula:**
s = T(r), where

- s represents the processed image pixel value
- r represents the original pixel value
- T represenats the transformational function

### Arithmetic operation on single image
Each pixel of the image is operated upon by a constant, C

### Arithmetic operation on multiple images
- Multiple source images can be added, multiplied, subtracted, and divided by the other to provide a new image (output)
- Point processing operation of two images can only occur when two images have the same amount of rows and columns

#### Addition image operation

#### Complications of arithmetic image operations
There are two complications associated to arithmetic image operations

**Color depth**
- The addition of two 8 bit greyscale images will result to a pixel value of above 255, which exceeds the color depth of either source
- This can be solved by truncation, where the intensity values is capped at 255 is the values exceeds 255 as well as rescaling

Rescaling
Find the maximum value of the image (imax) and divide each of the image pixel values by the maximum value of the image (imax) and multiply it by 255

- However, the process of truncation and rescaling is only done at the very last stage of the processing to minimize information loss

#### Subtraction image operation

#### Multiplication image operation

#### Division image operation

## Logical image operation

### Logical AND image operation
- In logical AND operation, a mask needs to be defined
- mask = segmentation / region of interest (area which is to be focussed on)
- The region of interest is defined by using the value of 255 while the region which we want to remove (do not focus on) is done by using the value of 0
- Any value which AND with 255 will remain back the same value while any value which AND with 0 will become 0

## Regional Contrast Adjustment
Refers to the adjustment of contrast in only certain parts of an image

three methods:
- logarithmic
- exponential
- power law

### Logarithmic transform
- increases dynamic range in dark region
- decreases dynamic range in bright regions

### Exponential transform
- increases dynamic range in bright region
- decreases dynamic range in dark regions

### Power Law transform
- Known as the combination of logarithmic and exponential transform
- maps a narrow range of input values into a wider range or output values

##  Bit-plane slicing
- Defined as the technique to determine the visual information of an individual pixel bit of an image
- Higher-order bits usually contain most of the significant visual information (refers to binary system).
- Lower-order bits contain subtle details.
