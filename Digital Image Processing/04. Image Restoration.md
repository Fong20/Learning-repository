# 04. Image Restoration 

## Image Enhancement
- A process of enhancing the image so that the result is more suitable than the original image for specific application.
- It is a subjective process. The viewer is the ultimate judge of how well a particular method works.

## Image Restoration
- An attempt to recover an image that has been degraded by using a prior knowledge of the degradation.
- In simple terms, it is a process of removing noise from the image
- image restoration is an objective process.

## Factors of image degradation
There are several factors contributing to image degradation. Image degradation could occur during the process of image acquisition (digitization) and / or transmission.

### 1. Acquisition (digitalization):
- Due to the image sensor.
- For example, in acquiring images with a CCD sensor, light levels and sensor temperature are major factors affecting the amount of noise in the resulting image.

### 2. Transmission:
- Occurs during the transmission of the image from one device to another
- It could also occur due to the interference of the channel used for transmission.
- For example, an image transmitted using a wireless channel might be corrupted as a result of lighting or other atmospheric disturbance.

## Composition of a degraded image
- Degraded image = degradation function * original image + noise
- Applies to both spatial domain and frequency domain

## Noise
Image noise is random variation of brightness or color information in images.

### Periodic noise
- Arises from electrical or electromechanical interference during image acquisition.
- Reduce via frequency domain filtering.

### Types of noise model
- Gaussian
- Rayleigh
- Gamma
- Exponential
- Uniform
- Salt and Pepper
- Periodic

## Spatial filtering
- A method of removing noise from the image by estimating the noise and removing it
- A method of choice in situations when only additive noise is present (i.e. without being affected by the degradation function).
- For non-periodic noise

### Types of spacial filtering
1. Mean filters (arithmetic mean filter, geometric mean filter)
2. Order-statistics filters (median filter, max and min filter, midpoint filter)

### Mean filters

#### Arithmetic Mean Filter
- The arithmetic mean filter is defined as the average of all pixels within a local region of an image
- A padding is introduced here which is the addition of rows and columns around the original image
- padding is added before performing the filtering process to prevent the window from exceeding the image

**How it works:**

Move the padding into the degraded image (addition) then divide by the size of the padding to get the new value

#### Geometric Mean Filter
- It replaces a pixel's value with the geometric mean of its neighboring pixels, used for blurring and noise reduction
- In term of smoothing, it is comparable to arithmetic mean. But this one tend to lose less image detail.

### Order-statistics filter
Order-statistics filters are relatively expensive and complex to compute due to the need of sorting all the values.

#### Median filter

#### Max and min filter
- Max filter finds the brightest points in an image.
- It is also useful for reducing the pepper noise.
- Min filter finds the darkest points in an image.
- It is useful for reducing the salt noise.

#### Midpoint filter
- Compute the midpoint between the maximum and minimum values in the area.
- Best for randomly distributed noise, like Gaussian or uniform noise.

Midpoint = (min + max) /2
