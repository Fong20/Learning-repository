# 04. Image Restoration 

## Image Enhancement
- A process of enhancing the image so that the result is more suitable than the original image for specific application.
- It is a subjective process

## Image Restoration
- An attempt to recover an image that has been degraded by using a prior knowledge of the degradation.
- In simple terms, it is a process of removing noise from the image
- image restoration is an objective process.

## Factors of image degradation
During the process of image acquisition (digitization) and / or transmission.

### Acquisition (digitalization):
- Due to the image senor.
- For example, in acquiring images with a CCD sensor, light levels and sensor temperature are major factors affecting the amount of noise in the resulting image.

### Transmission:
- Occurs during the transmission of the image from one device to another
- It could also occur due to the interference of the channel used for transmission.
- For example, an image transmitted using a wireless channel might be corrupted as a result of lighting or other atmospheric disturbance.

## Restoration of degraded image
1. Identify the composition of the degraded image. The composition is typically original image, f(x,y) + noise n(x,y)
2. Remove the noise from the image

## Noise

### Periodic noise
- Arises from electrical or electromechanical interference during image acquisition.
- Reduce via frequency domain filtering (later).


### Types of noise model
Gaussian
Rayleigh
Gamma
Exponential
Uniform
Salt and Pepper
Periodic

### Spacial filtering
- A method of removing noise from the image
- A method of choice in situations when only additive noise is present (i.e. without being affected by the degradation function).
- For non-periodic noise 

#### Types of spacial filtering
1. Mean filters (arithmetic mean filter, geometric mean filter)
2. Order-statistics filters (median filter, max and min filter, midpoint filter)

#### Arithmetic Mean Filter
The arithmetic mean filter is defined as the average of all pixels within a local region of an image

Add an empty row and column into the degraded image (addition) then divide by the number of 

#### Geometric Mean Filter
- It replaces a pixel's value with the geometric mean of its neighboring pixels, used for blurring and noise reduction
- In term of smoothing, it is comparable to arithmetic mean. But this one tend to lose less image detail.

#### Max and min filter

#### Midpoint filter
- Compute the midpoint between the maximum and minimum values in the area.
- Best for randomly distributed noise, like Gaussian or uniform noise.
