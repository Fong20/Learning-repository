# 05. Frequency Domain Processing

## Spatial domain
- In spatial domain, images are represented as by pixel intensities or brightness values at each position.
- This representation is intuitive for humans, as each pixel directly corresponds to a point in the image.

## Frequency domain 
- In frequency domain, the image is represented as frequency components, which describe how pixel values change across space.

### Frequency domain Components
1. low frequency components. This represents gradual changes and they are usually found in the center of the image with a bright light
2. high frequency components. These components represent fine details such as the edges and noise and are normally found outwards of the image.

## Image transformation
- As mentioned above, an image can be represented in the form of spatial domain and frequency domain. Hence, an image can be transformed from spatial domain to frequency domain and vice versa.
- Fourier Transform (FT) is a process which transforms an image from spatial domain to frequency domain
- Inverse fourier transform (IFT) is used to convert the image from frequency domain back to spatial domain

Why do we transform the image from spatial domain to frequency domain?

**1. Compact representation of image data**
- Packs a large fraction of the average energy of an image into a relatively few components of the transform coefficients (energy compaction property). 
- Since the total energy is preserved, this means many of the transform coefficients will contain very little energy. These coefficients may be neglected.
- Basically, less resources are used to process the image

**2.  Easier analysis**
- Isolation of image pattern into critical components such as low frequency components and high frequency components.

**3.  Mathematical convenience**
- Convolution in the spatial (or time) domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain

## Frequency Spectrum and Phase
Both the magnitude and the phase functions are necessary for the complete reconstruction of an image from its Fourier transform.

### Fourier Spectrum 
- Once an image is converted to frequency domain, we can evaluate its frequency through frequency spectrum. Frequency spectrum represents an image's frequency content.
- It is usually used in 2D-DFT due to its complex output.
- The component with zero frequency has the highest value.
- Magnitude gets smaller for higher frequencies.
- In general, it represents the illumination information.

### Phase
- Phase represents the shape information or positions (relative shifts) of those sine and cosine waves.
- Harder to view when compared to spectrum counterpart.

## Convolution
- Process of transforming an image by applying a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire image.
- Convolution process can be applied on both spatial domain and frequency domain
- Calculated by multiplicating the values of the filter kernel and the values of the image and adding them together

### How it works
The kernel slides across the image, and each pixel's value is calculated as a weighted sum of its neighboring pixels, determined by the kernel and divided by the size of the kernel.

**Note: The larger the filter kernel used, the more distorted and blur the image is.**

# Noise
Disrupts the accuracy of the image as the pixel numbers are not accurate.

Types of noise
1. Periodic noise
2. random noise

## Perodic noise
- Arises from electrical or electromechanical interference during image acquisition.
- Reduce via frequency domain filtering.

# Filters
Filters are used to remove image noise. Noise could be caused by the hardware used to capture the image or during transmission

## Filtering in frequency domain

**Types of filters**

There are several types of filters which can be used to remove image noise in frequency domain:
1. low pass (Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian)
2. high pass (Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian)
3. band pass
4. band stop
5. Notch

### Filtering process
1. Compute discrete fourier transform (DFT) to convert the image from spatial domain to frequency domain.
2. Find the filter function, H and multiply the image spectrum with the filter function to get the filtered image spectrum
3. Once the filtering process is done, compute inverse DFT to conver the image back to spatial domain

Image spectrum = image which has been converted into frequency domain

filtered spectrum = image which has been processed to remove noise

fast fourier transfer (FFT)

### Low pass filter
The main function of low-pass filters is to **smoothen the image in the frequency domain** by allowing low frequency components to pass through and reducing the high-frequency components.

**Types of low pass filters**
- ideal
- butterworth
- gaussian

### Ideal low pass filter
- Ideal low pass filter is done by cutting off all high frequency components that are a specified distance D0 from the origin of the transform.
- Point of transition between H(u,v) = 0 and H(u,v) = 1 is called the: Cut-off Frequency
- The higher the radius of the ideal low pass filter applied, the clearer the image is

### Butterworth low pass filter
- The higher the radius of the butterworth low pass filter applied, the clearer the image is

### Gaussian low pass filter
- combination of ideal low pass filter and butterworth low pass filter
- The higher the radius value of the gaussian low pass filter applied, the clearer the image is
- When inverse Fourier transform is performed on a Gaussian filter in the frequency domain, it will return a spatial Gaussian filter.

### High domain filters
- As mentioned, edges and fine detail in images are associated with high frequency components.
- High-pass filters **sharpen images in the frequency domain** by allowing high frequency components to pass through and removing low-frequency components. Thus, It is used to obtain edge information from the image
- High pass frequencies are precisely the reverse of low pass filters, thus, the formula can be defined as:

```math
Hhp(u, v) = 1 â€“ Hlp(u, v)
```

- ```Hhp``` = high pass filter function
- ```Hlp``` = low pass filter function

**Types of high pass filters**
- ideal
- butterworth
- gaussian

For high pass filters, the smaller the radius number, the clearer the image.

**Example: Comparision of image with different radius number applied for gaussian high pass filter**

## Degradation function
Before this, we always assumed that the images are only contaminated by either random noise or periodic noise which help us simplify the model. However, there is actually also degradation function (e.g. motion blur) as well.

### Estimating degradation function
There are several ways to estimate the degradation function:

1. Observation
2. Mathematical Models

**Formula to obtain degradation function**

## Image restoration
- Image restoration is performed with the main purpose of obtaining back the original image.
- The degraded image can be restored if we know the degradation function and the noise

**Formula to obtain back the original image**

After degradation function is known, some of the methods that can be used to restore the image:

1. Inverse Filtering
2. Wiener Filtering

### Inverse filtering
Inverse filtering is suitable when the degraded image is ONLY affected by the degradation function (in other words, image contains no noise / little noise).

### Wiener filtering
Wiener filtering is a better candidate if the degraded image is affected by BOTH degradation function and noise.
