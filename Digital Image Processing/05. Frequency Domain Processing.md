# 05. Frequency Domain Processing

## Spatial domain
- In spatial domain, images are represented as by pixel intensities or brightness values at each position.
- This representation is intuitive for humans, as each pixel directly corresponds to a point in the image.

## Frequency domain 
- In frequency domain, the image is represented as frequency components, which describe how pixel values change across space.

### Frequency domain Components
1. low frequency components. This represents gradual changes and they are usually found in the center of the image with a bright light
2. high frequency components. These components represent fine details such as the edges and noise and are normally found outwards of the image.

## Image transformation
- As mentioned above, an image can be represented in the form of spatial domain and frequency domain. Hence, an image can be transformed from spatial domain to frequency domain and vice versa.
- Fourier Transform (FT) is a process which transforms an image from spatial domain to frequency domain
- Inverse fourier transform (IFT) is used to convert the image from frequency domain back to spatial domain

Why do we transform the image from spatial domain to frequency domain?

**1. Compact representation of image data**
- Packs a large fraction of the average energy of an image into a relatively few components of the transform coefficients (energy compaction property). 
- Since the total energy is preserved, this means many of the transform coefficients will contain very little energy. These coefficients may be neglected.
- Basically, less resources are used to process the image

**2.  Easier analysis**
- Isolation of image pattern into critical components such as low frequency components and high frequency components.

**3.  Mathematical convenience**
- Convolution in the spatial (or time) domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain

## Convolution
- Process of transforming an image by applying a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire image.
- Convolution process can be applied on both spatial domain and frequency domain
- Calculated by multiplicating the values of the filter kernel and the values of the image and adding them together

### How it works
The kernel slides across the image, and each pixel's value is calculated as a weighted sum of its neighboring pixels, determined by the kernel.

**Note: The larger the filter kernel used, the more distorted and blur the image is.**
