# 05. Frequency Domain Processing

## Spatial domain

## Frequency domain 
- the image can only be recognized by its pixel values

## Techniques of converting an image from spatial domain to frequency domain
1. Convolution
2. Fourier Transform (FT)

## Convolution
- Process of translating an image from spatial domain to frequency domain
- Calculated by multiplicating the values of the filter kernel and the values of the image and adding them together

Note: The larger the filter kernel used, the more distorted and blur the image is

## Image transformation
Why do we transform the image from spatial domain to frequency domain?

1. Compact representation of image data
- Packs a large fraction of the average energy of an image into a relatively few components of the transform coefficients (energy compaction property). 
- Since the total energy is preserved, this means many of the transform coefficients will contain very little energy. These coefficients may be neglected.
- Basically, less resources   

2.  Easier analysis
- Isolation of image pattern into critical components.

Components in frequency domain image
Brighter light = low frequency components
Darker parts = high frequency components such as noise

3.  Mathematical convenience
- Convolution in the spatial (or time) domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.
