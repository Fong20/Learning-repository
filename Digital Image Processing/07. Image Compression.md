# 07. Image Compression
- Data compression refers to the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent a given quantity of information.
- Data compression is achieved when one or more of the data redundancies are reduced or eliminated.

**Type of image compression:**
1. Lossless (Remove data redundancy without removing any important data)
2. Lossy (Some data is loss)

## Data Redundancy
- The sentences contain “data” that either provide no relevant information or simply restate what is already known.

**Types of redundancy in digital image**
1. Coding Redundancy
2. Interpixel Redundancy
3. Psychovisual Redundancy

### Coding Redundancy

Number of pixels * number of bits allocated for each pixel 

**Huffman Coding**
- Coding redundancy can be eliminated by using variable-length code, and assign the shortest possible code words to the most probable gray levels.
- The Huffman coding is one of the most popular techniques for removing coding redundancies.

**Process**
1. Determine the probabilities of symbols under consideration
2. Arrange the symbols and combining the lowest probabilities symbols into a single symbol.
3. Working back from the combinations to determine the code words.
4. Encode each symbol (in this case, the value of each pixel).


### Interpixel Redundancy
- Generally, the value (magnitude, gray level) of any given pixel can be reasonably predicted from the value of its neighbor.
- Interpixel redundancy occurs when one or more pixels have the same pixel values

### Psychovisual Redundancy
- Certain information simply has less relative importance than other information in normal visual processing. This information is said to be psychovisually redundant.
- It can be eliminated without significantly impairing the quality of image perception.
- The elimination of psychovisually redundant data results in a loss of quantitative information, and it is commonly referred to as quantization.
- It is a irreversible operation (visual information is permanently lost), thus, quantization results in a lossy data compression.

## Compression ratio
Defined as the ratio of losing data from compressing the image

Formula:

CR = n1 / n2, where n1 = the number of words before compression and n2 = number of words after compression

## Fidelity Criteria
Quantifying the nature and extent of information loss is highly desirable.

**Types of fidelity criteria:**
1. Objective Criteria
2. Subjective Criteria

## Image Compression Model
- Based on the techniques for reducing or compressing the amount of data required to represent an image. These techniques are combined to form practical image compression systems.
