# 01. Introduction to Digital Image Processing

## 2-Dimensional Arrray
- A 2-dimensional array digital image means the image is represented by only rows (M) and columns (N)
- The number of rows and columns of an image depends on the size of the image
- Each of the row and columns are represented by a pixel value

### Common pixel values
- Black = 0
- White = 256
- Grey = 120

The maximum value of pixel value is 255, it cannot exceed 255.

## Types of image
- The types of image are determined by their pixel values and the number of layers /planes / arrays.
- There are three types of image which are grayscale, binary, and colour

### Binary image
- Image which contains only either black (0) or white (255) / 1

### Greyscale image (Intensity image)
- In a grayscale image, the value of each pixel represents only the intensity information of the light
- The pixel values represents the brightness of a pixel, ranging from 0 to 255.
- The smaller numbers closer to zero represent the darker shade while the larger numbers closer to 255 represent the lighter or the white shade.

#### Advantages of Greyscale Image
- Simplifies the amount of information in the image while maintaining the important features of the image
- More cost efficient (cheaper than color image)
- Easier to be processed by systems

### Color image (RGB Model)
- Constructed by three matrixes / layers, which are red, green and blue and each pixel has such three layers
- Pixel value can range from 0 to 255
- The combination of pixel values in red, green, and blue layers will produce a unique color image

**Example: Combination of pixel values in each layer will result to different colours**

## Resolution
There are two types of resolution

### Spatial resolution
- Specifies the dimension of the image
- It defines the number of pixels which are used to cover the visual space captured by the image (M x N)

### Intensity Resolution
- Specifies the range of pixel values of the image
- It defines the number of possible intensity/colour value that a pixel may have
