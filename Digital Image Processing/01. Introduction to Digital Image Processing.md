# 01. Intorduction to Digital Image Processing

## 2-Dimensional Arrray
- A 2-dimensional array digital image means the image is represented by only rows (M) and columns (N)
- The number of rows and columns of an image depends on the size of the image

Each of the row  and columns are represented by a pixel value

## Types of image
The types of image are determined by their pixel values

### Binary image
- Image which contains only either black (0) or white (255) / 1
Black = 0
White = 256
Grey = 120

### Greyscale image
Image which contains white, black and grey
Greyscale = 128

The maximum number of color value is 255, it cannot exceed 255

#### Advantages of Greyscale Image
- Simplifies the amount of information in the image while maintaining the important features of the image
- More cost efficient (cheaper than color image)
- Easier to be processed by systems

### Color image (RGB Model)
- Constructed by three matrixes / layers, which are red, green and blue
- value can range from 0 to 255
- the combination of pixel values in red, green, and blue layers will produce a unique color image

## Resolution
There are two types of resolution

### Spatial resolution
- Specifies the dimension of the image
- It defines the number of pixels which are used to cover the visual space captured by the image (M x N)

### Intensity Resolution
- Specifies the range of pixel values of the image
- It defines the number of possible intensity/colour value that a pixel may have
