# 08. Geometric transformation
- Image transformation serve as the starting point for other image transformation process
- Geometric transformation is used to transform an image from one coordinate system to another coordinate system

**Types of geometric transmission:**
1. Affine transformation
2. Projective transformation

## Affine transformation
- Involves shifting the coordinates of the image pixel along the x and y axis.
- The parallel lines are restricted to remain parallel to each other after transformation
- involves scaling, rotation, translation or shearing a set of points

scaling = reduces the size of the image along the x and y axis

## Projective transformation
- The parallel lines can no longer remain parallel when an image undergoes projective transformation
- Offers high degree of flexibility but takes more processing time and power as compared to affine transformation due to the increase in parameters from 6 to 8

## Forward and Inverse Mapping
Forward mapping = process of shifting the pixels from the original coordiate system to the new coordinate system (targeted coordinate system)

Inverse mapping = process of shifting the pixels from the new coordiate system (targeted coordinate system) to the original coordinate system

**Problem with inverse mapping**

inverse mapping will return the source coordinate in the form of a fractional number. Eg: (4,4) to (1.3,1.6) 

## Interpolation
- Interpolation is the process of using existing data to predict unknown data
- It can be used to increase / decrease the size of t
- Interpolation solves the problem faced by inverse mapping

**Types of interpolation method**
- Nearest neighbour
- Bilinear
