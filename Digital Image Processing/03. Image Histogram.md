# 03. Image Histogram
- The histogram shows the distribution of the gray levels in the image
- Plots the gray-levels against the count
- Frequency (count) = the number of occurence of the pixel values in the image
- gray-levels = the pixel values / intensity values in the grayscale image (0 - 255)

## Formula
`h(rk) = nk` where `rk` is the grey-levels (intensity values) and `nk` is the number of pixels in the image which have the grey-levels of rk

## Applications of Image Histogram
- To understand the characteristics of an image (brightness, contrast, etc..)
- To select a threshold value that can be used to separate foreground objects from the background. This increases the efficiency of image processing.

## Separating foreground objects from background
There are times when we want to focus on a particular object and ignore the rest of the objects. The object which we want to focus on would be set to the foreground while the rest of the objects which we would to ignore would be set to the background

There are two ways to set foreground objects and background
- Histogram threshold
- Element wise point to point muultiplication

### Histogram Threshold Selection
- Used for segmentation purpose in which we want to isolate an object of interest from the background (separate the foreground objects from the background)
- The pixel values which are higher than the threshold will be set to white (255) while the pixel values which are less than the threshold value wil be set to black (0). Hence, the greyscale image will also be converted into a binary image
  
intra-class variance = the difference between the foreground and background. 

### Adaptive Thresholding
Designed to overcome the limitations of normal thresholding by using a different threshold at each pixel locaton in the image

#### Formula:
t = mean + C
t = median + C

### Element-wise point to point multiplication
This method is performed by multiplying (Logical AND) the pixel values of the original image with the pixel values of a mask image

## Contrast adjustment

### Types of contrast adjustment
1. Contrast stretching
2. Histogram equlization
3. Histogram matching

### Contrast stretching
- Improve the contrast of an image by stretching the image

### Histogram Equalization
- A function that wish to make the histogram as equal as possible

### Histogram Matching (Histogram Specification)
- Allows us to match the grayscale distribution in one image to the grayscale distribution in another image
