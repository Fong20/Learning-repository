# 03. Image Histogram
- The histogram shows the distribution of the gray levels in the image
- Plots the gray-levels against the count
- Frequency (count) = the number of occurence of the pixel values in the image
- gray-levels = the pixel values / intensity values in the grayscale image (0 - 255)

## Formula
`h(rk) = nk` where `rk` is the grey-levels (intensity values) and `nk` is the number of pixels in the image which have the grey-levels of rk

## Applications of Image Histogram
- To understand the characteristics of an image (brightness, contrast, etc..)
- To select a threshold value that can be used to separate foreground objects from the background. This increases the efficiency of image processing.

## Separating foreground objects from background
There are times when we want to focus on a particular object and ignore the rest of the objects. The object which we want to focus on would be set to the foreground while the rest of the objects which we would to ignore would be set to the background

There are two ways to set foreground objects and background
- Histogram threshold
- Element wise point to point muultiplication

### Histogram Threshold Selection (Global threshold)
- Used for segmentation purpose in which we want to isolate an object of interest from the background (separate the foreground objects from the background)
- The pixel values which are higher than the threshold value set will be set to white (255) while the pixel values which are less than the threshold value wil be set to black (0). Hence, the greyscale image will also be converted into a binary image
  
intra-class variance = the difference between the foreground and background. 

### Adaptive Thresholding
- Designed to overcome the limitations of global thresholding by using a different threshold at each pixel locaton in the image
- Each of the pixel is allocated a different threshold value
- Threshold value is determined by the values of the pixels in the neighnourhood of the pixel

#### Formula:
- `t = mean + C`
- `t = median + C`
- `floor((max-min)/2) + C`

### Element-wise point to point multiplication
This method is performed by multiplying (Logical AND) the pixel values of the original image with the pixel values of a mask image

## Contrast adjustment
- Refers to the adjustment of contrast, which is the difference between the darkest and lightest tones, and colors, making objects and details visible.
- A high-contrast image will have very bright highlights and very dark shadows.
- A Low-contrast image have a more muted and subtle appearance, often with a wider range of mid-tones. 

### Types of contrast adjustment
1. Multiplication / Division Point Operation
2. Contrast stretching
3. Histogram equlization
4. Histogram matching

### Contrast stretching
Contrast stretching is an Image Enhancement method which attempts to improve an image contrast by stretching the range of intensity values.

**Example:**

If the minimum intensity value(r min) present in the image is 100 then it is stretched to the possible minimum intensity value 0. Likewise, if the maximum intensity value(r max) is less than the possible maximum intensity value 255 then it is stretched out to 255.(0–255 is taken as standard minimum and maximum intensity values for 8-bit images)

#### Downside
The new image output depends on the maximum and minimum pixel values which might not be an accurate representation of the general pixel range with the image

### Histogram Equalization
- A function that wish to improve the image contrast by spreading out the most frequent pixel intensity values or stretches out the intensity range of the image.
-  By accomplishing this, histogram equalization allows the image’s areas with lower contrast to gain a higher contrast.

#### Formula
`Sk = T(rk)` where rk is the input intensity, sk is the processed intensity, k is the intensity range, L is the number of gray levels, nj = the frequency of intensity j

### Histogram Matching (Histogram Specification)
Allows us to match the grayscale distribution in one image to the grayscale distribution in another image
