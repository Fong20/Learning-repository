# 03. Image Histogram
- The histogram shows the distribution of the gray levels in the image
- Plots the gray-levels against the count
- Frequency (count) = the number of occurence of the pixel values in the image
- gray-levels = the pixel values in the grayscale image (0 - 255)

## Formula
h(rk) = nk

Applications of Image Histogram
- To understand the characteristics of an image (brightness, contrast, etc..)
- To select a threshold value that can be used to separate foreground objects from the background

## Histogram Threshold Selection
- used for segmentation purpose in which we want to isolate an object of interest from the background
- The pixel values which are higher than the threshold will be set to white (255) while the pixel values which are less than the threshold value wil be set to black (0)
intra-class variance = the difference between the foreground and background. The threshold value is set

## Adaptive Thresholding
Designed to overcome the limitations of normal thresholding by using a different threshold at each pixel locaton in the image

Formula:
t = mean + C
t = median + C

## Contrast adjustment

### Types of contrast adjustment
1. Contrast stretching
2. Histogram equlization
3. Histogram matching

### Contrast stretching
- Improve the contrast of an image by stretching the image

### Histogram Equalization
- A function that wish to make the histogram as equal as possible

### Histogram Matching (Histogram Specification)
- Allows us to match the grayscale distribution in one image to the grayscale distribution in another image
