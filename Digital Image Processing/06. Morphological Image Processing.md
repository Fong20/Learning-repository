# 06. Morphological Image Processing
- Morphological process will affect the shape of the image
- It takes place at the binary level of the image

## Structuring Element (SE)


## Hit, Fit, and Miss



## Dilation
- involve sliding the SE throughout the entire image.
- When any one of the SE pixels, which carries a value of ‘1’, “hits” another pixel that also carries a value of ‘1’ in the binary image, output a ‘1’ at the origin of the SE.


Symbol:

### Dilation Process: 
- Identify the origin of the SE.
- Rotate the SE about the origin (IMPORTANT !!!). (Rotate by 180o)
- Slide the SE across the entire image.

### Uses of dilation
1. Image character
- Dilation is used to increase the size of the letters in the image

2. Edge Detection
- Dilation is also used to obtain the edge

## Erosion

### Uses of Erosion
1. Shrink the objects in the image
2. Split joined objects
3. Strip away extrusions (any unsmooth surface)

**Example: Separating joined coins to count individual coins**

## Opening
- Opening functions similar to erosion, but it is less destructive where

## Closing
- Closing functions similar to dilation. It remove holes without causing the region of interest to grow bigger
