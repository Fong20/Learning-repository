# 06. Morphological Image Processing
- Morphological process will affect the shape of the object in the image
- It can be used as a tool for extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of region shape.
- Morphological operations are usually applied to binary images, because they may contain numerous imperfections, for example, after thresholding. However, it can also be applied to greyscale images.

## Structuring Element (SE)
- Defined as a small binary image that is used to probe an image during morphological operations. It basically defines the neighborhood of pixels over which the operation is performed.
- The shape and size of the structuring element can greatly influence the outcome of the morphological operation.

## Hit, Fit, and Miss
To understand hit, fit, and miss, a structuring element and binary image is provided

- Hit occurs when at least one of the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object

- Fit occurs when all the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object

- Miss occurs when none of the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object.

## Types of morphological image processing operations
There are four types of morphological image processing operations which are:
1. Dilation
2. Erosion
3. Opening
4. Closing

## Dilation
- involve sliding the SE throughout the entire image.

### Dilation Process: 
- Identify the origin of the SE.
- Rotate the SE about the origin (IMPORTANT !!!). (Rotate by 180o)
- Slide the SE across the entire image.
- When any one of the SE pixels, which carries a value of ‘1’, “hits” another pixel that also carries a value of ‘1’ in the binary image, it will output a ‘1’ at the origin of the SE.

**Example 3:**

The larger the SE used for dilation, the larger the object in the image.

### Uses of dilation

**1. Image character**
- Dilation is used to increase the size of the letters in the image

**2. Edge Detection**
- Dilation is also used to obtain the edge

3. Repair breaks
- Dilation can also repair breaks by filling small holes

## Erosion
- Erosion process also involve the sliding the SE throughout the entire image.

**Example:**

The larger the SE used for erosion, the smaller the object in the image.

### Erosion Process: 
1. Identify the origin of the SE.
2. Slide the SE across the entire image.
3. If the entire SE can “fit” into the foreground (‘1’), write a ‘1’ at the origin of the SE.

**Symbol: ⊖**
   
### Uses of Erosion
1. Shrink the objects in the image
2. Split joined objects
3. Strip away extrusions (any unsmooth surface)

## Opening
- Opening is the process where erosion is performed first, followed by dilution.  It is primarily used to remove small objects or noise from an image while preserving the shape and size of the larger objects.
- The erosion step removes small objects and noise.
- The dilation step restores the size of the remaining objects. However, since the smaller objects were completely eroded away in the first step, they are not restored, effectively removing them from the image.
- Erosion removes small objects, but is also reduces the size of the regions of interest.
- Can be used for spot and noise removal without affecting the remaining parts.

## Closing
- Closing is the inverse process of opening where dilution is performed first, followed by erosion. It is used to close small holes, gaps, or spaces within the foreground objects while preserving their overall shape.
- Dilation expands the boundaries of the foreground objects (white regions) in the binary image. This step helps in filling small holes or gaps within the objects.
- Erosion then shrinks the boundaries back, restoring the original size of the objects. However, any small holes or gaps that were filled during the dilation step will remain filled, effectively "closing" them.
