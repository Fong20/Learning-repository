# 06. Morphological Image Processing
- Morphological process will affect the shape of the object in the image
- It can be used as a tool for extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of region shape.
- Morphological operations are usually applied to binary images, because they may contain numerous imperfections, for example, after thresholding. However, it can also be applied to greyscale images.

## Structuring Element (SE)
- Defined as a small binary image that is used to probe an image during morphological operations. It basically defines the neighborhood of pixels over which the operation is performed.
- The shape and size of the structuring element can greatly influence the outcome of the morphological operation.

## Hit, Fit, and Miss
To understand hit, fit, and miss, a structuring element and binary image is provided

- Hit occurs when at least one of the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object

- Fit occurs when all the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object

- Miss occurs when none of the pixels in the structuring element cover the pixels of the object.

## Types of morphological image processing operations
There are four types of morphological image processing operations which are:
1. Dilation
2. Erosion
3. Opening
4. Closing
   
## Dilation
- involve sliding the SE throughout the entire image.
- When any one of the SE pixels, which carries a value of ‘1’, “hits” another pixel that also carries a value of ‘1’ in the binary image, output a ‘1’ at the origin of the SE.

### Dilation Process: 
- Identify the origin of the SE.
- Rotate the SE about the origin (IMPORTANT !!!). (Rotate by 180o)
- Slide the SE across the entire image.

### Uses of dilation
1. Image character
- Dilation is used to increase the size of the letters in the image

2. Edge Detection
- Dilation is also used to obtain the edge

## Erosion

### Uses of Erosion
1. Shrink the objects in the image
2. Split joined objects
3. Strip away extrusions (any unsmooth surface)

**Example: Separating joined coins to count individual coins**

## Opening
- Opening functions similar to erosion, but it is less destructive where

## Closing
- Closing functions similar to dilation. It remove holes without causing the region of interest to grow bigger
