# 01. Data models

## Introduction
- What is a Model?:** Abstraction of a real world object or event**
- **Data modeling:** Iterative and progressive process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem
domain
- **Data models:** Simple representations of complex real world data structures

## Importance of data models
- Act as a communication tool
- Provide an overall view of the database
- Organize data for various users
- Act as an abstraction for the creation of good database

## Important aspects of a data model (Basic building blocks)
- Entity = Unique and distinct object (noun) used to collect and store data. Eg: department, subject etc
- Attribute = Characteristics of an entity Eg: HOD, subject code etc
- Relationship = Describes an association among entities
- Constraint = Set of rules to ensure data integrity.

  ### Examples of relationships
  - **One to many** (1:M) Eg: one department offers many subjects; one subject has many enrolments
  - **Many to many** (M:N or M:M) Eg: one student enrolls in many subjects and one subject has many enrolments
  - **One to one** (1:1) Eg: one department has one HOD
 

## Business rules
- also refers to constraints in the database.
- It provides Brief, precise, and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure, or principle and defines the basic building blocks.

  ### Importance of business rules
  - Business rules are important as they define the conditions that the database must meet.
  - It helps to standardize companyâ€™s view of data
  - It acts as a communication tool between users and designers
  - It allows the designers to Understand the nature, role, scope of data, and business processes, Develop appropriate relationship participation rules and
constraints and Create an accurate data model.

## Database concepts

  ### Schema
  Schema is the **conceptual organization of the entire database as viewed by the database administrator.**
  
  ### Subschema
  Portion of the database seen by the application programs that produce the desired information from the data within the
  database.

## Relational model
- It was introduced by Dr E.F.Codd in 1970
- The fundamentals of relational model is based on mathematical concept (predicate logic and set theory)

  ### Important terms
  - Relation = table/file
  - Tuple = rows/record
  - attribute = columns/field
 
## Entity relationship model
- Graphical representation of entities and their relationships in a database structure
- Entity relationship diagram (ERD) uses graphic representations to model database components

  ### Important terms
  - Entity instance / Entity occurence = rows
  - Connectivity = term used to label relationship types
 
  ### Benefits and disadvantages of entitiy relationship model

## External model
- It is the end user's view of the data environment
- Entity relational diagrams (ERD) are used to represent external views
- External schema : Specific representation of an external view

## Conceptual model
- Represents a global view / overall view of the entire database by the entire organization
- Conceptual schema : Basis for the identification and high level description of the main data objects
- It is software and hardware independent.
- Logical design : The task of creating a conceptual data model

  ### Difference between external model and conceptual model
