# 01. Data models

## Introduction
- What is a Model?: **Abstraction of a real world object or event**
- **Data modeling: **Iterative and progressive process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem
domain**
- **Data models: **Simple representations of complex real world data structures**

## Importance of data models
- Act as a communication tool
- Provide an overall view of the database
- Organize data for various users
- Act as an abstraction for the creation of good database

## Important aspects of a data model (Basic building blocks)
- Entity = Unique and distinct object **(noun)** used to collect and store data. Eg: department, subject etc
- Attribute = Characteristics of an entity Eg: HOD, subject code etc
- Relationship = Describes an association among entities **(verb)**
- Constraint = Set of rules to ensure data integrity.

  ### Examples of relationships
  - **One to many** (1:M) Eg: one department offers many subjects; one subject has many enrolments
  - **Many to many** (M:N or M:M) Eg: one student enrolls in many subjects and one subject has many enrolments
  - **One to one** (1:1) Eg: one department has one HOD
 

## Business rules
- Business rules are often implemented as constraints in the database.
- It provides brief, precise, and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure, or principle which must be followed. Hence, business rules are required to design a data model.

  ### Source of business rules
  - company managers
  - policy makers
  - department managers
  - written documentation
  - direct interviews with end users
  
  ### Importance of business rules
  - Business rules are important as they define the conditions that the database must meet. If there were no business rules, the database would be too general and do not solve the specific to the scenario.
  - It helps to standardize companyâ€™s view of data
  - It acts as a communication tool between users and designers
  - It allows the designers to Understand the nature, role, scope of data, and business processes, Develop appropriate relationship participation rules and constraints and Create an accurate data model.

## Database concepts

  ### Evolution of data models
  - Data model basically transitioned from Hierarchical to network to relational to object oriented to noSQL

  ### Schema
  - Schema is the **conceptual organization of the entire database as viewed by the database administrator.**
  - It is basically the entire database.
  
  ### Subschema
  Portion of the database seen by the application programs that produce the desired information from the data within the
  database.

## Relational model
- It was introduced by Dr E.F.Codd in 1970
- The fundamentals of relational model is based on mathematical concept (predicate logic and set theory)
- In a relational model, a table can relate with different tables

  ### Important terms
  - Relation = table/file
  - Tuple = rows/record
  - attribute = columns/field

  ### Advantages and disadvantages of relational model

  ### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
  - Performs basic functions provided by hierarchical and network DBMS systems
  - It makes the relational data model easier to understand and implement as it hides the complexities of the relational model from the user.

## Entity relationship model
- **Graphical representation of entities** and **their relationships in a database structure**
- Entity relationship diagram (ERD) uses graphic representations to model database components
- It is **both hardware and software independent**

  ### Important terms
  - Entity instance / Entity occurence = rows
  - Connectivity = term used to label relationship types

  ### Types of Entity Relationship model notations
  - crow's foot notation
  - UML class diagram notation
    
  ### Advantages and disadvantages of entitiy relationship model

## External model
- It is the **end user's view of the data environment**
- **Entity relational diagrams (ERD) are used to represent external views.**
- External schema : Specific representation of an external view

## Conceptual model
- Represents a **global view / overall view of the entire database of the entire organization**
- Conceptual schema : Basis for the identification and high level description of the main data objects
- It is **software and hardware independent.**
- **Logical design** : The **task of creating a conceptual data model**

  ### Difference between external model and conceptual model

## Internal model
- Internal model is basically the scripts which we type in. It maps the conceptual model to the DBMS
- Internal schema: Specific representation of an internal model
- It is **software dependent and hardware independent**
- **Logical independence:** **Changing internal model without affecting conceptual model**

## Physical model
- Operates at the **lowest level of abstraction** (does not hide the complexity of the function from the user)
- It **describes the way data in the particular table is saved in storage medias such as hard disks or tapes**
- It is **both hardware and software dependent**
- **Physical independence:** **Changes in physical model do not affect internal model.**

## Degree of data abstraction for each models
**Hierachical and network data models have the least degree of abstraction** whereas **entity relationship model has the highest degree of abstraction.**
