# 00. Database systems

## Data vs Information

  ### Data
  - Is the collection of raw facts which have not been processed.
  
  ### Information
  - Information are data which has been processed.
  - It reveals the meaning of the data and enables knowledge creation.
  - It should be accurate, relevant, and timely to enable good decision making.

## How was data stored in the past?
Data was stored in the past initially by using manual file systems whereby file folders were kept in cabinets.

  ### Evolution of file systems
  Eventually, people **shifted from manual file systems to computerized file systems** and **to modern productivity programs such as microsoft excel.**

  ### Downsides of file systems
  - Lengthy development time. 
  - Difficulty of getting quick answer
  - Complex system administration. Programs will need to be constantly updated if there are additional data to be added.
  - Lack of security and limited data sharing
  - Extensive programming

## Structural dependence vs Structural Independence (file structure)
  ### Structural dependence
  - Access to a file is dependent its structure.
  - All file system programs are required to be modified to conform to the new file structure.

  ### Structural independence
  - Access to a file is not dependent on its own structure.
  - File structure is changed without affecting the application’s ability to access the data.

## Data dependence vs Data Independence 
### Data dependence
- **data access changes when data storage characteristics change**
- Eg: when we change data from hdd to ssd, we need to change the program to access the data from ssd instead.

### Data independence 
- **data access does not change when data storage characteristics change**
- **data storage characteristics is changed** without **affecting the program’s ability to access the data.**

  There are 2 types of data independence:
  - **Logical data independence (change conceptual schema)** = we **do not need to change the program which access the table** when the **file structure is changed.** Eg: add new columns, remove new columns from table etc..
  - **Physical data independence (change physical schema)** =  we **do not need to change the program which access the table** when the **data structure is changed.** Eg: change/upgrade storage system

## Data redundancy
- Data redundancy is an example of poor database design. It is basically the unnecessarily storing of same data at different places.
- **Islands of information**: Information which are scattered in different locations. This increases the probability of having different versions ofthe same data.

### Implications of data redundancy
- Poor data security. Higher probability of acquiring the same data.
- Data inconsistency
- Increased likelihood of data entry errors when complex entries are made in different files
- Data anomaly (data abnormality) : Develops when not all of the required changes in the redundant data are made successfully. It is abnormal to keep making changes to the same data.

## Introduction to database
Database is a Shared, integrated computer structure / central repositary that stores a collection of data.

  ### Types of database
  - **Centralized database** : Data is located at a single site.
  - **Distributed database** : Data is distributed/stored across different sites.
  - **Cloud database** : Data resides on the Internet.
    
  ### Types of data stored by database
  There are two types of data which are stored by database:
  - **End user data** = Raw facts of interest to end user (**data which are inputted by the user**)
  - **Metadata** = **Data about data** (data type of the column etc)

## Database management system (DBMS)
- Is a form of software which manages the database structure.
- Not only that, it also controls access to the data stored in the database.
- Hence, it eliminates most of the traditional file system's problem.
- Eg: ORACLE, MySQL, MS SQL etc..

   ### Role of DBMS
  - It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.
  - Enables**data to be shared.**
  - Presents the end user with an **integrated view of the data.**
  - Receives and translates application requests into operations required to fulfill the requests.
  - Hides database’s internal complexity from the application programs and users.

  ### Functions of DBMS
  **Data dictionary management**
  - Data dictionary : Stores definitions of the data elements and their relationships.
  
  **Data storage management**
  - Performance tuning Ensures efficient performance of the database in terms of storage and access speed.
  
  **Data transformation and presentation**
  - Transforms entered data to confirm to required data structures.
  
  **Security management**
  - Enforces user security and data privacy.

  **Multiuser access control**
  - Sophisticated algorithms **ensure that multiple users can access the database concurrently without compromising its integrity.**
  
  **Backup and recovery management**
  - Enables recovery of the database after a failure.

  **Data integrity management**
  - Minimizes redundancy and maximizes consistency

  **Database access languages and application programming interfaces**
  - Query language : Lets the user specify what must be done without having to specify how
  - Structured Query Language (SQL) De facto query language and data access standard supported by the majority of DBMS vendors

  **Database communication interfaces**
  - Accept end user requests via multiple, different network environments

  ### DBMS vs file system
  In DBMS, all the data of different departments are managed by a single centralized software whereas for file system, different file management programs are required to manage different data in their respective departments.

  ### Advantages of DBMS
  - Better data integration and less data inconsistency. Data inconsistency refers to Different versions of the same data which appear in different places
  - Increased end user productivity
  - Improved:
    - Data sharing
    - Data security
    - Data access
    - Decision making using quality data. Promoting accuracy, validity, andtimeliness of data

  ### Disadvantages of DBMS
  - Increased costs
  - Management complexity. Database administrator is required to maintain the database
  - Maintaining currency
  - Vendor dependence. Eg: If the company uses Oracle DBMS, it is stuck to Oracle as its main vendor.
  - Frequent upgrade/replacement cycles. DBMS has to be updated to the latest version

## Database design
- Database design focuses on the design of the database structure thatwill be used to store and manage end user data.
- A well designed database Facilitates data management and generates accurate and valuable information.
- A poorly designed database causes difficult to trace errors.

## Basic file terminology
- Field = columns
- Record = rows of data
- file = data of the whole table
