# 04. Normalization
- Normalization is a process breaking down a huge table into smaller forms based on functional dependency. It is also used to evaluate and correct table structures to minimize data redundancies and reduce data anomalies
- Atrributes are assigned to tables based on functional dependency (FD)

**Types of normal forms:**
1. First normal form (FNF)
2. Second normal form (SNF)
3. Third normal form (3NF)

## Functional dependencies and keys
Functional dependencies are enforced based on the keys in the relation

**Two types:**
- functional dependent 
- fully functional dependent (dependent on all the the keys)

**Criterias for functional dependency:**
- Functional states that for every value in the x field, there exists a value in a field y.
- When y is functional dependent to x, x can determine y.

**Example 1:**
- LAUNCHPRICE can determine the MODEL. LAUNCHPRICE is functional dependent on MODEL since each value in the MODEL belongs to only one value in the LAUNCHPRICE
- MODEL cannot determine the MANUF. MODEL is not functional dependent on MANUF since there are two identical values of APPLE in the MANUF which are belongs to two values in the launchprice

**Example 4:**
- The PK of the HIRE table is SCODE + DHIRED
