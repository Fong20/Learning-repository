# 04. Normalization
- **Normalization is a process breaking down a huge table into smaller forms based on functional dependency.** It is also used to evaluate and correct table structures to minimize data redundancies and reduce data anomalies
- Atrributes are assigned to tables based on functional dependency (FD)

**Types of normal forms:**
1. First normal form (FNF)
2. Second normal form (SNF)
3. Third normal form (3NF)

## Functional dependencies and keys
Functional dependencies are enforced based on the keys in the relation

**Two types:**
- functional dependent 
- fully functional dependent (dependent on all the the keys)

**Criterias for functional dependency:**
- Functional states that for every value in the x field, there exists a value in a field y.
- When y is functional dependent to x, x can determine y.

**Example 1:**
- LAUNCHPRICE can determine the MODEL. LAUNCHPRICE is functional dependent on MODEL since each value in the MODEL belongs to only one value in the LAUNCHPRICE
- MODEL cannot determine the MANUF. MODEL is not functional dependent on MANUF since there are two identical values of APPLE in the MANUF which are belongs to two values in the launchprice

**Example 4:**
- The PK of the HIRE table is SCODE + DHIRED

## Zero normal form
A table is said to have zero normal form if it has multivalues or repeating group or both of it

  ### Multivalue and Repeating group
  multivalue = single field which contains multiple values. A field is said to have multivalue if there exist at least one row of the field which contains multiple values.
  
  Repeating group is a group of fields which contains multiple values and are related to each other and it is tied to a single entity 
  
  **Example: Repeating group**
  
  The project field and time field are repeating groups as the values of each row of the project field is related to the values of each row of the time field

  ### Derived attributes
  Derived attributes are attributes which are derived from other attributes. Eg: age, total

## First normal form 
A table is said to be in first normal form when it does not have repeating group/multivaue

Criterias to convert zero normal form to first normal form
  - remove repeating group
  - remove derived attributes
  - assign a primary key

  A table is said to be first normal form when it has a PK and every row of the field is atomic (has only one value)

## Second normal form
A table is said to be second normal form when it is in first normal form and does not have partial dependencies

  ### Partial dependency
  - Partial dependency = Part of the key which could be either one of the composite key and it is sufficient to determine other fields
  - Partial dependency occurs when our PK is a composite key

## Third normal form
Transitive dependency = fields which are not part of the key (non key attributes) which can determine other non key attributes

After breaking down the table to the third normal form, we need to ensure that all the broken tables can be join back. We can do this by identifying the PK and introduce foreign key to join the tables. The foreign key is determine through the many sign

A table is said to be in third normal form when:
- it is in second normal form
- does not have transitive dependencies
