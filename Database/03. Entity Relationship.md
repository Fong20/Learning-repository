# 03. Entity relationship model
ERD represents the database viewed by the end user

## Database main components
1. Entity (noun)
2. Attributes = characteristics of the entity
3. Relationship (verb) = associativity between entities

## Attributes
- Required attribute
- Optional attribute

Domain = a set of possible values for an attribute
Identifiers = One or more attributes that uniquely identify each entity

### Types of attributes
1. Composite identifier = primary key
2. Composite attribute = an attribute which be break down into additional attributes (Eg: address)
3. Simple attribute = attribute that cannot be further broken down
4. Single-valued attribute = attribute which can only have one value in a row
5. Multivalued attributes = attribute which contains more than one value in one row
6. Derived attribute = attribute which its value is calculated from other attributes

## Relationships
- Relationhips are association between entities that always operate in both directions
- Note: We always read the relationship starting with one/each

  ### Types of relationships
  - one to one
  - one to many
  - many to many

  ### Optional relationship participation
  In optional participation, **one entity occurrence does not require a corresponding entity occurrence in a particular
relationship**

  ### Mandatory relationship participation
  In mandatory relationship participation, **one entity occurrence requires a corresponding entity occurrence in a particular relationship**

  ### Crow Foot's symbol to represent relationships
  The following table showcases the symbols used to represent entity relationships.

  **Example:**

  The following crow's foot symbol represent the relationship:
- one professor can teach multiple classes
- one class is taught by one professor
- The cardinality (1,1) means it has 1 row in the professor table
- The cardinality (1,4) means it has 4 rows in the class table

  ### Associative entities
  - Also known as composite or bridge entity
  - It is **used to represent many to many relationship between two or more entities**

  **Example:**
  The following exmaple showcases that a many to one relationship can be divided into two one to many relationship. The enroll entity is known as the composite entity.

## Weak entity
- A weak entity is an entity in which its existence is dependent on another entity.
- It has a primary key that is partially or totally derived from parent entity in the relationship.

  Example:
