# 02. Relational Database Model

## Logical view of Data
- logical view is designed to suit the need of different users by representing data in a meaningful format
- relational database model (RDM) enables logical representation of the data and its relationships
- RDM provides simple and effective database design methodologies and the data and it relationships are stored in relations

## Characteristics of a relational table
- Relation = table
- Tuple = Rows
- Attributres = columns
- attrribute domain = range of values
- Key attribute = Attribute that is a part of a key

## Keys
Keys consists of **one or more attributes that is able to determine other attributes**

  ### Function of keys
  - Ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable
  - Establish relationships among tables and to ensure the integrity of the data

  ### Types of keys
  - Primary key (PK): **Attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies any given row** (all the rows for the particular field of the table must be unique and cannot have duplicate values). All the values in the primary key must be unique and cannot be null. (Eg: student id)
  - Composite key/concatenated key/compound key: : **Primary Key that is composed of more than one attribute**
  - Superkey: Primary key with additional unique rows
  - Candidate key: All possible primary keys
  - Alternate key: Keys which are not selected as primary key
  - Secondary key: An attribute or combination of attributes which are used strictly for data retrieval purposes
  - Foreign key = used for linking tables, it is derived from the primary key of other table. All the values of the foreign key must be able to be found in the primary key of the table or be null

  **Example:**
  - The primary key for product table is prod_code whereas the primary key for the vendor table is vend_code.
  - The foreign key is vend_code as it is derived from the primary key of the vendor table

  Key attribute = attributes inside the primary key
  
  ### Entity integrity
  - Entity integrity: refers to the Condition of the primary key in which **each row in the table has its own unique identity (unique and distinct)**
  - **All of the values in the primary key must be unique**
  - **No key attribute in the primary key can contain a null**

  ### Referential integrity
  - refers to condition of the foreign key.
  - The values of foreign key can be null and repeated.
  - All the values of the foreign key must be found in the primary key of the table
    
  ### Null
  Null is **known as the absence of any data value** that could be due to:
  - An unknown attribute value
  - A known, but missing , attribute value
  - An inapplicable condition

## Relational set operators
table = set
select = display a particular field of a table
project
Union = combines all rows from two tables, excluding duplicate rows
intersect = shows only the rows that appear in both table

## Data dictionary and system catalog
- Data dictionary = Description of all tables in the database created by user and the designer
- System catalog = System data dictionary that describes all objects within the database

  **Homonyms and synonyms must be avoided to lessen confusion**
  - Homonym : Same name is used to label different attributes. Eg: cent, scent; fare, fair
  - Synonym : Different names are used to describe the same attribute. Eg: studentNo, studentID
 
## Relationship within Relational Database

## Relational database and data redundancy
Relational database facilitates control of data redundancies through use of foreign keys

However, there are certain situations where data redundancy is required:
- Data redundancy must be increased to make the database serve crucial information purposes
- Exists to preserve the historical accuracy of the data

## Index
- An index or database index is a **data structure which is used to quickly locate and access the data
in a database table.**
- Indexes are **created using some table / database columns.**
- Each index is associated with only one table
