# 02. Relational Database Model

## Logical view of Data
- logical view is designed to suit the need of different users by representing data in a meaningful format
- relational database model (RDM) enables logical representation of the data and its relationships
- RDM provides simple and effective database design methodologies and the data and it relationships are stored in relations

## Characteristics of a relational table
- Relation = table
- Tuple = Rows
- Attributres = columns
- attrribute domain = range of values
- Key attribute = Attribute that is a part of a key

## Keys
Keys consists of one or more attributes that is able to determine other attributes

  ### Function of keys
  - Ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable
  - Establish relationships among tables and to ensure the integrity of the data

  ### Types of keys
  - Primary key (PK): **Attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies any given row** (all the rows for the particular field of the table must be unique and cannot have duplicate values). All the values in the primary key must be unique and cannot be null.
  - Composite key: : Primary Key that is composed of more than one rows
  - Superkey: Primary key with additional unique rows
  - Candidate key: All possible primary keys
  - Secondary key: An attribute or combination of attributes which are used strictly for data retrieval purposes
  - Foreign key = used for linking tables, it is derived from the primary key of other table. All the values of the foreign key must be able to be found in the primary key of the table or be null

  **Example:**
  - The primary key for product table is prod_code whereas the primary key for the vendor table is vend_code.
  - The foreign key is vend_code as it is derived from the primary key of the vendor table

  ### Entity integrity
  - Entity integrity: Condition in which **each row in the table has its own unique identity (unique and distinct)**
  - **All of the values in the primary key must be unique**
  - **No key attribute in the primary key can contain a null**

  ### Null
  Null is **known as the absence of any data value** that could be due to:
  - An unknown attribute value
  - A known, but missing , attribute value
  - An inapplicable condition
