# 04. HCI in the Software Process

## Software Lifecycle

### Software Lifecycle Processes
1. Requirements specification
2. Architectural design
3. Detailed design

## Usability
Defined as the extnet to which a product can be used by specified users to acheove specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

### Nielsen's 5 quality components of Usability

### Ways of Measuring Usability

1. Learnability
- Pick novice users of the system and measure the time to perform certain tasks
- The less time taken to perform certain task, the more usable the system is.

2. Efficiency
- Get a sample of expert users and measure the time taken to perform certain tasks.

3. Memorability
- Get a sample of casual users who are away from the system for a certain time or duration, and measure the time to perform certain tasks.

4. Errors
- count the number of minor and catastrophic erros made by the users when performing a task
  
5. Satisfaction
- ask the user for feedback after trying out the system
  
### Usabilty Engineering
- The term usability engineering describes a process of user interface development,sometimes referred to as user centred design.
- It is a lifecycle process that puts an early emphasis on user and task analysis and actual user involvement in the design and testing of a product.
- A product developed with such a user centred processis likely to be a more usable product than one that is developed independent of user considerations and involvement.

#### Usability Engineering Lifecycle
1. User and Task Analysis
2. Identify usability goals and perform comperitive analysis (Checking out similar products)
3. Conduct Parallel Design (designers should work independently, then compare draft designs)
4. Conduct Participatory Design (Gather a pool of representative users and  conduct guided discussion of prototypes, paper mock mock-ups, screen designs
with representative users.)

## Design Thinking
Design rationale is information that explains why a computer system is the way it is.

### Benefits of Design Thinking
- communication throughout life cycle
- reuse of design knowledge across products
- enforces design discipline
- presents arguments for design trade trade-offs
- organizes potentially large design space
- capturing contextual information

### Design Thinking Process
1. Empathize: Deeply understand the needs, motivations, and behaviors of the people you are designing for through observation and interviews.
2. Define: Synthesize your findings from the empathize stage to create a clear, user-focused problem statement.
3. Ideate: Brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions without judgment, building on the insights from the define stage.
4. Prototype: Create low-fidelity, tangible versions of your ideas to explore solutions. This can include sketches, mockups, or role-playing.
5. Test: Test your prototypes with users to get feedback and learn what works and what doesn't, which may lead you to return to earlier stages.
