### Ways of Measuring Usability
1. Learnability
- Pick novice users of the system and measure the time to perform certain tasks
- The less time taken to perform certain task, the more usable the system is.

2. Efficiency
- Get a sample of expert users and measure the time taken to perform certain tasks.

3. Memorability
- Get a sample of casual users who are away from the system for a certain time or duration, and measure the time to perform certain tasks.

4. Errors

5. Satisfaction

### Usabilty Engineering
- The term usability engineering describesdescribesaprocessprocessof user interface development, development,sometimes referredreferredto as user centred designdesign.
- It is a lifecycle process that puts an early emphasis on user and task analysis and actual user involvement in the design and testing of a product.
- A product developed with such a user centred processis likely to be a more usable product than one that is developed independent of user considerations and involvement.
