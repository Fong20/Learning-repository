# 01. Introduction to Human Computer Interaction
Human Computer Interaction is a discipline concerned with the study, design, construction, and implementation of human-centric interactive computer systems.

## Importance of HCI
- HCI is considered the first impression. People now expect “easy to use” systems. They are not tolerant of poorly designed systems. If a product is hard to use, they will seek other products

## UI vs UX
- UI is described as the visual aspect of a system. This includes buttons, colors, etc.
- UX is described as the design of the implentation of feature to enhance the user's experience. This includes the placement of buttons, etc

Main issue faced when designing UI and UX is that designers assumes that the user knows everything (the perfect user)

## Ergonomics
- Concerned with the physical aspect of interfaces. It is the study of the physical characteristics of interaction.
- Ergonomics good at defining standards and guidelines for constraining the way we design certain aspects of systems to suit the environments/users

**Examples:**
1. arrangement of controls and displays
- e.g. controls grouped according to function or frequency of
use, or sequentially (mapping)

2. surrounding environment
- e.g. seating arrangements adaptable to cope with all sizes of user (movie theatre)

3. health issues
- e.g. physical position, environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), lighting, noise

4. use of colour
- e.g. use of red for warning, green for okay, awareness of colour blindness etc.

## HCI Components
As mentioned, Human computer interaction consists of three main components:
1. Human
2. Computer
3. Interaction

### 1. Humans
- Humans are considered as the user of the system
- They are limited in their capacity to process information
- In order to design, it is important to understand the capabilities and limitations of the audience which we are designing for.

### Human and environment interaction
Humans interact with the environment through input-output channel which consists of:
1. Vision
2. Audio
3. Touch
4. Movement
   
### Human memory
- Humans are able to remember things thanks to the human memory.

**Sensory memory**
- Sensory memory is a collection of sensory information
- There are three types of sensory memory which are, iconic memory (sight), echoic memory (siund), and haptic memory (touch)

**Short term memory**
- Acts as a buffer for stimuli received through senses

**Long term memory**
- Acts as a repository for all our knowledge

**Types of long term memory**
1. episodic – collection of past events allowing a person to relieve the experience
2. semantic – structured memory of general, factual knowledge about the world, like the meaning of words, concepts, and common facts, that isn't tied to a specific personal experience

### Human Factors
There are four factors that affect how people interact with computers and computer programs

#### 1. Physiology
- Concerns the physical interaction between users and computer systems
- Eg: Reaction time, disabilities

#### 2. Cognition
- The processes in which the user becomes acquainted with things ; how the users gain knowledge, familiarity
- Eg: user's goals, information presentation

**Example: User's Goals**

**Example: Information Presentation**

#### 3. Perception
- how a person perceives the input obtained through their senses

#### 4. Emotion
- feelings that affect the human behaviour

**Implications for interface design**
- stress will increase the difficulty of problem solving
- relaxed users will be more forgiving of shortcomings in design
- aesthetically pleasing and rewarding interfaces will increase positive affect

### Human Errors and Mental Model in HCI
There are two types of error in HCI

#### 1. slips
- User has the right intention, but performed the wrong action
- causes: poor physical skill, inattention etc.
- change to aspect of skilled behaviour can cause slip

#### 2. mistakes
- wrong intention
- cause: incorrect understanding

#### Mental Model
A mental model is an internal, generalized, and simplified representation of how something works, such as a system, situation, or event. 


### 2. Computer
A computer system is made up of various elements

**Elements that affects the interaction**
1. input devices – text entry and pointing
2. output devices – screen (small & large), digital paper
3. virtual reality – special interaction and display devices
4. physical interaction – e.g. sound, haptic , bio bio-sensing
5. paper – as output (print) and input (scan)
6. memory – RAM & permanent media, capacity & access
7. processing – speed of processing, networks

### 3. Interaction
Interaction is a process of information transfer, from the user to a computer and from a computer to the user

#### Donald Norman's Execution-Evaluation Cycle
- It is one of the most influential model of interaction
- Norman divides interaction into execution and evaluation

**1. Execution**
- Executuion is defined as user activities aimed at making the system do something
- If the user fails to operate the system to acheive the task required, e.g cannot understand how to do it, unclear icons, unclear indication etc, It will **result in the Gulf of Execution**

**2. Evaluation**
- Evaluation is the process of analyzing if the system did actually do what the user wanted
- If user cannot see what happened to system, e.g if system has done what they want but no feedback is given to the users etc. This creates a difference between the representation of the system state/result and the expectations of the user.
- Hence, it will **result in the Gulf of Evaluation**

**Gulf of Execution vs Gulf of Evaluation**
- The gulf of execution is the gap between a user's goal and the system's capabilities, while the gulf of evaluation is the gap between a system's state and the user's ability to understand that state.
- Designers bridge the gulf of execution by making actions discoverable, clear, and intuitive. Meanwhile, designers bridge the gulf of evaluation by providing clear, timely, and understandable feedback that helps users interpret the system's status and assess if their goal was achieved.
