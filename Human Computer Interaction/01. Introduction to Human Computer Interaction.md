# 01. Introduction to Human Computer Interaction
Human Computer Interaction is a discipline concerned with the study, design, construction, and implementation of human-centric interactive computer systems.

## Importance of HCI
- HCI is considered the first impression. People now expect “easy to use” systems. They are not tolerant of poorly designed systems
- if a product is hard to use, they will seek other products

## UI vs UX
- UI is described as the visual aspect of a system. This includes buttons, colors, etc.
- UX is described as the design of the implentation of feature to enhance the user's experience. This includes the placement of buttons, etc

Main issue faced when designing UI and UX is that designers assumes that the user knows everything (the perfect user)

## Ergonomics
- Concerned with the physical aspect of interfaces. It is the study of the physical characteristics of interaction
- Ergonomics good at defining standards and guidelines for constraining the way we design certain aspects of systems to suit the environments/users

**Examples:**
1. arrangement of controls and displays
- e.g. controls grouped according to function or frequency of
use, or sequentially (mapping)

2. surrounding environment
- e.g. seating arrangements adaptable to cope with all sizes of user (movie theatre)

3. health issues
- e.g. physical position, environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), lighting, noise

4. use of colour
- e.g. use of red for warning, green for okay, awareness of colour blindness etc.

## HCI Components

### 1. Humans

### Human memory
- Humans are able to remember things thanks to the human memory.

Sensory memory
- The human memory is sensory memory
- there are three types of sensory memory which are, iconic memory, echoic memory, and haptic memory

#### Short term memory


#### Long term memory
Repository for all our knowledge
 huge or unlimited capacity
 Two types
 episodic – serial memory of events
 semanticsemantic– structured memory of fact,
concepts, skills
 semantic LTM derived from episodic LTM

### Human Factors
Factors that affect how people interact with computers and computer programs

#### Physiology

#### Cognition

#### Perception

#### Emotion

### Human Errors and Mental Model in HCI
There are two types of error in HCI

1. slips
- right intention, but failed to do it right
- causes: poor physical skill, inattention etc.
- change to aspect of skilled behaviour can cause slip

2. mistakes
- wrong intention
- cause: incorrect understanding

Mental Model = 

### 2. Computer
A computer system is made up of various elements

Elements that affects the interaction
1. input devices – text entry and pointing
2. output devices – screen (small & large), digital paper
3. virtual reality – special interaction and display devices
4. physical interaction – e.g. sound, haptic , bio bio-sensing
5. paper – as output (print) and input (scan)
6. memory – RAM & permanent media, capacity & access
7. processing – speed of processing, networks

### 3. Interaction
Interaction is a process of information transfer, from the user to a computer and from a computer to the user

#### Donald Norman's Execution-Evaluation Cycle
- It is one of the most influential model of interaction
- Norman divides interaction into execution and evaluation

Execution
- User activities aimed at making the system do something

Evaluation
- Evaluating whether the system did actually do what the user wanted
