## Task Analysis
- A method/set of methods for understanding the tasks users carry out with a product/system
- To analyze the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing; what are they trying to achieve, why are they trying to achieve it, and how are they going about it?
- To investigate an existing situation
- Can be used for many different purposes within design and evaluation activities….

Informs us (in detail) as to:
- how users use existing products
- how users may interact with future products

Can be used to:
■ improve current design
■ identify potential problems with new design
■ identify requirements for new design
■ design training materials and manuals
■ develop evaluation plans

### Task Analysis Process
1. Identify the task to be analyzed: Pick a persona and scenario for your user research, and repeat the task analysis process for each one. What is that
user’s goal and motivation for achieving it?
2. Break this goal (high-level task) down into subtasks: You should have around 4–8 subtasks after this process. If you have more, then it means that your
identified goal is too high-level and possibly too abstract.
3. Draw a layered task diagram of each subtask and ensure it is complete
4. Write the story: A diagram is not enough. Many of the nuances, motivations and reasons behind each action are simply lost in the diagram, because all
that does is to depict the actions and not the reasons behind them. Make sure
you accompany your diagram with a full narrative that focuses on the whys.
5. Validate your analysis: review the analysis with someone who was not involved in the decomposition, but who knows the tasks well enough to check
for consistency.

### Hierarchical Task Analysis
- HTA is a commonly used means of breaking tasks down into a hierarchy of goals, operations (actions) and plans'
- It involves breaking a task down into subtasks and then into sub – subtasks
- These are then grouped together as plans that specify how the tasks might be performed in an actual situation

#### HTA Process
- The starting point is a user goal, then examined the main tasks associated with achieving that goal. Where appropriate, these tasks are subdivided into subtasks
- Start with the overall goal (verb-noun pair), e.g. “Use email”, “Print a letter”
- Break these down into meaningful subgoals/tasks (asking how question)
- Break down subgoals further until reach an appropriate stopping point
- Add plans to the analysis - conditional statements, often utilising boolean logic, e.g. DO 1, THEN 2, THEN (IF condition = true) DO 3, ELSE DO
4, THEN EXIT
- Represent the goals, subgoals, operations and plans using either:
• graphical views (boxes and arrows)
• non-graphical methods (e.g. tabulation, outlines,
textual)

#### HTA Representation
- HTA can be represented in graphical and textual
