# 07. Universal Design
Universal Design is the process of designing products so that they can be used by as many people as possible in as many situations as possible.

## Objectives
1. Designing products to be flexible enough and can be directly used
2. Designing products to be compatible with the assistive technologies - those who cannot efficiently access and use the products directly.

## Universal Design Principles
There are 7 principles in Universal Design

1. equitable use - Useful to people with a range of abilities and appealing to all
2. flexibility in use - Allows for a range of ability and preference, through choice of methods of use and adaptivity to the user’s pace, precision and custom
3. simple and intuitive to use - Support user’s expectations and accommodate different language, literacy, academic skills
4. perceptible information - Presentation should be presented in effectively; represented in different forms/modes
5. tolerance for error - Minimize the impact/damage caused by mistakes/unintended behavior
6. low physical effort - Comfortable to use, minimizing physical effort and fatique
7. size and space for approach and use - Comfortable to use, minimizing physical effort and fatique


## Usable senses in Universal Design
- The 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, taste and smell) are used by us every day to provide a fuller interaction with the natural world
- However, computer systems can only use sight, sound, and touch

## Mult-modal vs Multi-media systems

### Multi-modal systems
- use more than one sense (or mode ) of interaction
- e.g. visual and aural senses: a text processor may speak the words as well as echoing them to the screen

### Multi-media systems
- use a number of different media to communicate information
- e.g. a computer-based teaching system: may use video, animation, text and still images: different media all using the visual mode of interaction; may also use sounds, both speech and non-speech: two more media, now using
a different mode
