Golden Rule of Design
1. Understanding computers
2. Understanding people
3. Understanding interaction

## Design process
There are 4 design processes
1. requirements
2. analysis
3. design 
4. implementation and deployment (testing is included in implementation)

**Evaluation methods**
- heuristic testing
- user testing

## User Focus
1. Know your user
2. persona
3. cultural probes

### Know your user
• who are they?
• talk to them
• watch them
• use your imagination

#### User Profiling
User profiling is the process of establishing knowledge about the users

It finds out
- who the users are (Eg: Children, Elderly, Professional, Scientist, Male, Female, Tech Savvy, IT Illiterate)
- what is the goal in using the product (Eg: Withdraw cash, pay bills, find out movie time, online chat, gaming, research, cook, wash, treatment)
- what are the tasks involved? (observe existing work practices)

Example: 

To apply for leave: check schedule, get leave application form from admin, fill in the form, get supervisor to approve, get manager to approve, inform scheduler, inform colleagues, go on leave.

#### User requirement
User requirement wishes to identify and capture the characteristics of the intended user group. These characteristics include

1. Physical characteristics
- height; physical abilities or disabilities

2. Background
- education; social; religious

3. Skills
- task experience

4. Preferences
- efficiency

### Persona
Persona is a fictional individual created to describe the typical user based on the user profile.

### Cultural Probes
Cultural probes are an approach to qualitative user research where face-to-face research is impractical or inappropriate. They consist of prompts, questions and instructions along with artifacts for recording thoughts and feelings. The artifacts may be as simple as a diary or as elaborate as a single-use camera.

Cultural probes often take the form of small kits of artifacts supplied to participants such as:
- Postcards
- Maps
- A disposable camera
- A photo album and media diary

### Scenarios
Scenario is a story that describes how a particular persona completes a task or behaves in a given situation

### Tasks
- A task is a specific activity or action performed by a user to achieve a goal. These tasks are often broken down into smaller subtasks and actions.
- For example, the goal might be "make a purchase," and the tasks include "add item to cart," "enter payment information," and "confirm order".
