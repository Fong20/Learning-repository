Golden Rule of Design
1. Understanding computers
2. Understanding people

## Design process
There are 4 design processes

- design 
- implementation and deployment (testing is included in implementation)

Evaluation methods
- heuristic testing
- user testing

## User aspect

## User Focus
1. Know your user
2. persona
3. cultural probes

### Know your user
• who are they?
• probably not like you!
• talk to them
• watch them
• use your imagination

### Persona
Persona is a fictional individual created to describe the typical user based on the user profile.

### Cultural Probes
• direct observation
– sometimes hard
• in the home
• psychiatric patients, 

■ Cultural probes are one way to access environments that are difficult to observe directly and also to capture more of this 'felt life'.
• probe packs
– items to prompt responses
• e.g. glass to listen at wall, camera, postcard
– given to people to open in their own environment
they record what is meaningful to them

### Scenarios
Scenario is a story that describes how a particular persona completes a task or behaves in a given sitauation

• communicate with others
– designers, clients, users
• validate other models
– ‘play’ it against other models
• express dynamics
– screenshots – appearance
– scenario – behaviour

### User Profiling
- The process of establishing knowledge about the users

It finds out
■ who the users are (Eg: Children, Elderly, Professional, Scientist, Male, Female, Tech Savvy, IT Illiterate)
■ what is the goal in using the product (Eg: Withdraw cash, pay bills, find out movie time, online chat,
gaming, research, cook, wash, treatment)
■ what are the tasks involved? (observe existing work practices)

Example: 

To apply for leave: check schedule, get leave application form from admin, fill in the form, get supervisor to approve, get manager to approve, inform scheduler, inform colleagues, go on leave.
