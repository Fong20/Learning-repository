# 00. What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of directions known as tags which tell the web browser how to display and manage the web document. These tags perform functions such as displaying graphics, formatting text, and referencing hyperlinks.
- Web browsers are needed to run HTML files.

## Elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- It consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.
  
  Note: Not all elements will have an end tag. An example will be the break element

## Components of a HTML file
  
  ### <!DOCTYPE> declaration
  - <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that the document is a HTML document type.
  - It only appears once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
  - The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive

  ### HTML element
  - The HTML element indicates that the document is HTML formatted.
  - The HTML element also indicates the language used in the document. Eg: html lang = 'en' indicates that it is in English language
    
  ### Head element
- The head element contains the head section
- There are two elements in the head section which are the title element and meta element

  ### Title element
- The title element specifies the title of the HTML page which is shown on the browser's page tab.
- It is the first element in the head element
- <title> = start tag, </title> = end tag

  ### Meta element
  - The meta element describes the character encoding of a web page. Character encoding is the internal representation if letters, numbers, and symbols.
  - the meta charset = "utf - 8" defines that the utf-8 character encoding standard is used for the web page.

  ### Body element
- Defines the body of the HTML document, which houses all the contents such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists etc..


## Creating Headings
There are 6 levels of heading in HTML with the largest being <h1> tag and the smallest being <h6> tag

## Creating Paragraphs
- In order to create paragraphs, we use the paragraph element.
- Text being type in a paragraph will have an empty space above and below it.

## Create a Line break
- The line break element causes the browser to advance to the next line before displaying the next
element or portion of text on a web page. 
- The line break tag is an empty element which means it does not contain end tags.

## Blockquotes
- Blockquotes are used when we want to insert quotes / contnent which are quoted from another source.
- The text is indented from both left and right margins

## Phrase elements
- Phrase elements indicate the context and meaning of the text based on the respective element tags.
- Each browser interprets the style differently

  ### Example of phrase elements

## Lists
Lists are used on web pages to organize information.

There are three types of list
- ordered list
- unordered list
- description list

  ### Ordered lists
  Ordered list uses numbering or lettering system to organize information in a list

    ### Changing attributes of an ordered list
    - We can **change the attributes of ordered list** by using **type, start and reveresed attribute**
    - The type attribute is configures the symbol used for the ordered list
    - The start attribute changes the starting number of the ordered list
    - reveresd attribute (reversed = "reveresed") changes the order from ascending to descending

  ### Unordered list
  An unordered list uses bullet or shapes to organize information in a list

## Inserting special characters 
In order to use special symbols such as quotation marks, the greater-than sign (>), the less-than sign (<), and the copyright symbol (©) in your web page document, we need to use special
characters, sometimes called **entity characters (or HTML entities).**

## Inserting hyperlinks using the anchor element
- To insert a hyperlink, we need to use the anchor element
- **href** describes the destination of the hyperlink

  ### Types of hyperlink
  There are two types of hyperlinks which we can insert by using the anchor element
  - absolute = An absolute hyperlink indicates the absolute location of a resource on the Web. The href value
  for an absolute hyperlink to the home page of a website includes the http:// or https:// protocol
  and the domain name.

  - relative = Relative hyperlink is one that is in relation to where the current HTML document is related. They are useful when you need to link to web pages within your site. The href
  value for a relative hyperlink does not begin with the http:// or https:// and does not include a
  domain name but it will contain only the file name, folder or directory of the web page you want to display.

## Structural elements
Structural elements is basically the structure and the different elements contained of the website.

Aithough different websites will have different functionality, content, look and feel, they will generally have the same structural element.
1. Header (or masthead) at the top of the page, usually containing the top level heading of the page, and/or a company logo. This is the big bold statement at the top of the page that
says what the website is and who it belongs to.
2. Main content column, which holds the main content of functionality you are here to use.
3. One or more sidebars, holding peripheral content that is either related to the page’s main
content and changes as new pages are loaded (e.g., related links), or is always relevant
and persists across the whole site (e.g., “shopping cart” information on an e-commerce
site).
4. Navigation menu going across or down the page. This is often put in a sidebar, or may
form part of the header.
5. A footer that goes across the bottom of the page and contains secondary information such
as copyright information and contact details.
