# 06. Subqueries, set operators and other join

## Subqueries
- Subquery is a SQL query which is nested inside a larger query. It is normally used to extract data without the need for join condition
- It can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or inside another subquery
- It is usually added within the WHERE clause of another SQL SELECT statement
- Subquery is used alongisde the IN operator to retrieve data from multiple tables

**General rule of subquery:**

The innermost query will be executed first followed by the main query

The following join condition code is equivalent to the subquery code

### Example 1: Two sub-queries of the same level

### Example 2: Two sub-queries of different levels

## Set operations

**Types of set operations**
1. UNION
2. INTERSECT
3. MINUS

  ### UNION set operator
  The UNION set operator is used to obtain data from both tables

  **Note: The two tables are only union compatible when they have the same number of columns and their columns have identical data types and lengths**

  **Example:**

  ### INTERSECT set operator
  The INTERSECT operator is used to obtain the common data of two tables (data which is found in both tables)

  **Example:**

  The following code demonstrates the difference between using INTERSECT and normal operation using AND.

  ### MINUS set operator
  The MINUS set operator is used to show the data of only a particular table by removing the data of another table

  **Example:**

  The following example showcases the importance of the table positioning as it will yield different results.

## Other Joins
There are two types of join condition
1. Inner join
2. Outer join

  ### Inner join 
  **The inner join compares the tables in the FROM clause and lists only rows that satisfy the condition in the WHERE clause**

  ### Outer join
  **The outer join list all rows from one of the tables (left or right) in a join condition regardless of whether they match any rows in other table.** It basically functions similar to the inner join but it lists rows that do not match.
  
  **There are two types of outer join:**
  1. Left outer join
  2. Right outer join
  
  ### Left outer join (emphasis on the left table)
  - Left outer join means all the data from the left table will be displayed regardless of whether they match the data from the right table.
  - The left table is determined after the FROM

  **Syntax**

  **LEFT OUTER JOIN left_table_name ON join condition**

  **Example:**

  In the following code, **the left table is the rrcustomer table** whereas **the right table is the hire table.** Thus, l**eft outer join will display all the data of the rrcustomer table regardless if it matches the data of the hire table.**

  ### Right outer join (emphasis on the right table)
  Right outer join means all the data from the right table will be displayed regardless of whether they match the data from the left table

  **Syntax:**

  **RIGHT OUTER JOIN left_table_name ON join condition**
  
 **Example:**

  In the following code, **the left table is the orderline table** whereas **the right table is the part table.** Thus, **right outer join will display all the data of the part table regardless if it matches the data of the orderline table.**
