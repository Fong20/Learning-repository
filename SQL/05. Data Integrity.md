# 05. Data Integrity
Data Integrity ensures that the data which is being stored is consistent and adhere to the constraints set.

## What is a constraint?
Constraint is used to define one or more conditions in which a userâ€™s entry must satisfy before the data is saved into the table.

**Types of constraint**
- not null
- unique
- check

## Not null
The NOT NULL constraint **prohibits the field values from being null**

**Syntax:**

field_name NOT NULL

Example:
In the following code, ORACLE provided a default constraint name as we did not provide a constraint name. The letter C means it is of CHECK constraint type.

## Unique
The UNIQUE constraint **prohibits multiple rows of the field from having the same value in the same column or combination of columns but allows some values to
be null**

**Syntax:**

CONSTRAINT field_name UNIQUE

**Example:**
The letter U means it is of UNIQUE constraint type.

## Check 
The CHECK constraint **requires the field values to comply with a specified condition.**
**Syntax:**

CONSTRAINT field_name CHECK(condition)

**Example:**
The letter C means it is of CHECK constraint type.

## Primary key
The PRIMARY KEY constraint **combines a NOT NULL constraint and a unique constraint in a single declaration**

**Syntax:**

CONSTRAINT field_name PRIMARY KEY

Example:
The letter P means it is of PRIMARY KEY constraint type.

## Foreign key
The foreign key constraint **requires values in one table to be found in the primary key of the another table.**

**Syntax:**

CONSTRAINT field_name REFERENCES (table of the original priamry key(Primary key))

**Example:**
The letter R means it is of REFERENCE constraint type.
