# 02. Primary keys & Foreign Keys

## Retrieving data from several tables
We can combine data from two tables together by using the product condition or join condition

  ### Product condition
  By using product condition, it will return the rows of the first table followed by the rows of second table

  Syntax:
  
  SELECT *
  
  FROM
  
  model, appliance;

  ### Join condition
  - We use join condition to combine data from more than one table into a single list
  - PK = primary key
  - FK = foreign key

  Syntax:
  
  SELECT table1.columnname, table2.columname
  
  FROM table1, table2
  
  WHERE
  
  parent_table.PK = child_table.FK

  Note: We need to specify the table name if both of the table have identical column names.

  ### Rules for joining
  - If there are n number of tables to join, there must be n-1 number of join conditions.
  - Example: If there are 3 tables to be joined, then we need to have 2 join conditions

  In this case, there are three tables which are rrcustomer , hire , and appliance. Thus, we need to specify two join conditions which are rrcustomer .cust_num = hire .cust_num  and hire .stock_num = appliance .stock_num

  ### Join using a composite key
  - A composite key is a primary key which consists of multiple columns
  - If there is a composite key, we must make sure that every part of the primary key is joined to other tablle's foreign key

    Syntax :

    SELECT ...
    
    FROM
    
    table1, table2
    
    WHERE
    
    table1.primary_key_part_1 = table2.foreign_key_part_1
    
    AND
    
    table1.primary_key_part_2 = table2.foreign_key_part_2
    
    AND
    
    table1.primary_key_part_3 = table2.foreign_key_part_3;

## Aggregate functions
An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

## Grouping data
We can group identical data into a single group by using the GROUP BY clause in conjunction with the SELECT statement. The ORDER BY clause can only be used after the GROUP BY clause.

  ### Rules of grouping
  When performing grouping of data, the attributes in the SELECT clause must be mentioned in the GROUP BY clause as well

  ### Having subclause
  The HAVING subclause is used to impose a condition on the GROUP BY clause

## Change the order of records
We can change the order of records by using the ORDER BY clause. The ORDER BY clause will sort the records through ascending order by default.

We can also change the order of multiple records. The DESC is to specify that we want to sort the columns in descending order.

## Showing unique values (Do not show duplicate values)
We can filter to show only values which are different and do not have duplicate value by using either DISTINCT or UNIQUE clause.
