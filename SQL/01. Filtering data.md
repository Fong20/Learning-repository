# 01. Filtering data

## Basic rules
- When we want to find a specific data in the database, we need to use the WHERE clause.
- Comparison operators such as =, != , <>, >, <, <= and logical operators such as AND, OR , NOT can be used in the WHERE clause for all datatypes.
- When filtering data based on text, we need to ensure that the string is enclosed in single quotes.


## Find data which contains specific text in it
- We can use wildcards to find a small bit of text anywhere within a column. In this case, it uses the LIKE clause and the symbol %
- The LIKE clause is case sensitive.

### Example 1:
Example: find all records that contain the word chrome anywhere within the product name.

### Solution
The following syntax means that **extract all the information from the table name product as long as it contains the word CHROME along with any characters after the word CHROME. Eg: CHROME2, CHROME3 etc..**

  SELECT*
  
  FROM product
  
  WHERE prod_name LIKE 'CHROME%';

The following syntax means **extract all the information from the table name product as long as it contains the word CHROME along with any characters before and after the word CHROME. Eg: ACHROMEB etc..**

  SELECT *
  
  FROM product
  
  WHERE prod_name LIKE '% CHROME%';
