# 01. Filtering data

## Basic rules
- When we want to find a specific data in the database, we need to use the WHERE clause.
- Comparison operators such as =, != , <>, >, <, <= and logical operators such as AND, OR , NOT can be used in the WHERE clause for all datatypes.
- When filtering data based on text, we need to ensure that the string is enclosed in single quotes.

## Find data based on a range of values
- When searching for data containing values located in a certain range, we can use **WHERE <= AND >=** or **BETWEEN AND**
- It is recommended to use **BETWEEN AND** as is it simpler and more efficient.

- To search for data which is not within a a specific range, we can use **< OR >** or **NOT BETWEEN AND**

## Find data based on a group of values
- To search for data based on a group of values, we can either use **= OR** or use the **IN** clause.
- It is recommended to use IN clause as it reduces the number of times we need to type = if we have a lot of information.

## Find data which contains specific text in it
- We can use **wildcards** to find a small bit of text anywhere within a column. In this case, it uses the LIKE clause and the symbol %
- The LIKE clause is case sensitive.

### Example 1:
Find all records that contain the word chrome anywhere within the product name.

  ### Solution
  The following syntax means that **extract all the information from the table name product as long as it contains the word CHROME along with any characters after the word CHROME. Eg: CHROME2, CHROME3 etc..**
  
  SELECT*
  
  FROM product
  
  WHERE prod_name LIKE 'CHROME%';
  
  The following syntax means **extract all the information from the table name product as long as it contains the word CHROME along with any characters before and after the word CHROME. Eg: ACHROMEB etc..**

  SELECT *
  
  FROM product
  
  WHERE prod_name LIKE '%CHROME%';

### Example 2:
Find all records which have a single letter in between letter W and D.

  ### Solution
  The following _ in the syntax represents a random single digit character. 
  SELECT *
  
  FROM product
  
  WHERE
  
  prod_name LIKE '%W_D%';
