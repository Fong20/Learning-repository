# 00. Introduction to SQL

## What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language; SEQUEL, it was developed in the mid 70’s at IBM San Jose.
- It is a non procedural language to manage relational databases ( non procedural means it does not support looping)
- It is normally used by database administrators, developers (writing data integrationscripts) and data analysts (looking to set up and run analytical queries).

## SQL commands
There are several types of SQL commands

### Data Query Language (DQL)
•SELECT = retrieve certain records from one or more tables.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
•INSERT = create a record.
•UPDATE = change certain records.
•DELETE = delete certain records.

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
•CREATE = create a new table or a view of a table in database.
•ALTER = modify an existing database object, such as a table.
•DROP = delete an entire table or a view of a table in the database.

### Data Control Language (DCL)
•GRANT give a privilege to someone.
•REVOKE take back privileges granted to someone.

## Datatypes
Datatype defines what type of data which can be inserted into the particilar field.

  ### Common datatypes
  
  **Character**
  - CHAR = stores fixed-length character strings, if it has any empty spaces which are not used, those empty spaces will not be compressed.
  - VARCHAR/VARCHAR2 = stores variable-length character strings, if it has any empty spaces which are not used, those empty spaces will be compressed which means it will store uptill the character u type in only.
  - If we try to store a string longer than the maximum length of a CHAR or VARCHAR column, a turncation error will occur and the following codes will not be executed.

  Eg: VARCHAR(10) means it can accept up to 10 bytes of characters
  **Numeric**
  - NUMBER = stores positive and negative fixed, zero and floating point numbers.
  - When we want to dictate specific range of numbers to be inputted in the table, we need to include **precision** and **scale** , NUMBER(precision, scale), or else the database will just receive the numbers as it is.
  - **precision** = total number of digits
  - **scale** = decimals
  - for decimals, it will always round up the values

  **Date**
  - DATE = stores the year, month, day, hours, minute, seconds
  - The default ORACLE date format is DD-MON-YY

## Creating a table
Syntax: 
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name1 datatype, column_name2 datatype, ...
);

Eg:
**CREATE TABLE** table_name(

firstname VARCHAR(20), surname CHAR(15)

);

## Inserting a record into the table
Syntax:
**INSERT INTO** table_name **VALUES**(value1, value2, value3);

## Select records/view data from table

  ### Syntax to view attributes of a column
  
  **SELECT** column_name1 
  
  **FROM** table_name;

## Delete records in a table
Syntax:

**DELETE FROM** table_name

WHERE coloumn_name = 'item';

## Drop a table
Syntax:

**DROP TABLE** table_name;

## Describe a table structure
Syntax:

**DESC** table_name;
