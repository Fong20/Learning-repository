# 00. Introduction to SQL

## What is SQL?
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language; SEQUEL, it was developed in the mid 70â€™s at IBM San Jose.
- It is a non procedural language to manage relational databases ( non procedural means it does not support looping)
- It is normally used by database administrators, developers (writing data integrationscripts) and data analysts (looking to set up and run analytical queries).

## SQL commands
There are several types of SQL commands

### Data Query Language (DQL)
- SELECT = retrieve certain records from one or more tables.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- INSERT = create a record.
- UPDATE = change certain records.
- DELETE = delete certain records.

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
- CREATE = create a new table or a view of a table in database.
- ALTER = modify an existing database object, such as a table.
- DROP = delete an entire table or a view of a table in the database.

### Data Control Language (DCL)
- GRANT give a privilege to someone.
- REVOKE take back privileges granted to someone.

## Datatypes
Datatype defines what type of data which can be inserted into the particilar field.

  ### Common datatypes
  
  **Character**
  - CHAR = stores fixed-length character strings, if it has any empty spaces which are not used, those empty spaces will not be compressed.
  - VARCHAR/VARCHAR2 = stores variable-length character strings, if it has any empty spaces which are not used, those empty spaces will be compressed which means it will store uptill the character u type in only.
  - If we try to store a string longer than the maximum length of a CHAR or VARCHAR column, a turncation error will occur and the following codes will not be executed.

  Eg: VARCHAR(10) means it can accept up to 10 bytes of characters
  
  **Numeric**
  - NUMBER = stores positive and negative fixed, zero and floating point numbers.
  - When we want to dictate specific range of numbers to be inputted in the table, we need to include **precision** and **scale** , NUMBER(precision, scale), or else the database will just receive the numbers as it is.
  - **precision** = total number of digits
  - **scale** = decimals
  - for decimals, it will always round up the values

  **Date**
  - DATE = stores the year, month, day, hours, minute, seconds
  - The default ORACLE date format is DD-MON-YY

## Creating a table
Syntax: 
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column_name1 datatype, column_name2 datatype, ...
);

Eg:
**CREATE TABLE** table_name(

firstname VARCHAR(20), surname CHAR(15)

);

## Inserting a record into the table

  ### Syntax for inserting a record into specific columns in a table
  **INSERT INTO** table_name(column_name1, column_name2, column_name3) 
  
  **VALUES**(value1, value2, value3);

  ### Syntax for inserting a record into all columns in a table
  **INSERT INTO** table_name 
  
  **VALUES**(value1, value2, value3);

  Note: Make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.

## Select records/view data from table

  ### Syntax to view all data of the table
  **SELECT** *

  **FROM** table_name;
  
  ### Syntax to view data of a particular column
  **SELECT** column_name1 
  
  **FROM** table_name;

  ### Syntax to view data of a particular row

  **SELECT** column_name
  
  **FROM** person **WHERE** firstname = 'Jane'

## Delete specific information in a table
Syntax:

**DELETE FROM** table_name

WHERE coloumn_name = 'item';

## Deleting all information in a table
We can use TRUNCATE TABLE statement to delete all data in the table.

**Syntax:**

**TRUNCATE TABLE** table_name;

## Deleting a table
We can use the drop table statement to delete the whole table.

**Syntax:**

**DROP TABLE** table_name;

## Describe a table structure
We can use the DESCRIBE command to describe the structure of the table. It will show the name of the column, datatype of each column, precision and scale, and the nullability which means if the column can contain null values or not.

**Syntax:**

**DESC** table_name;
