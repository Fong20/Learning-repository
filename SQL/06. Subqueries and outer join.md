# 06. Subqueries and outer Joins

## Subqueries
- Subquery is a SQL query which is nested inside a larger query. It is normally used to extract data without the need for join condition
- It can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or inside another subquery
- It is usually added within the WHERE clause of another SQL SELECT statement
- Subquery is used alongisde the IN operator to retrieve data from multiple tables

**General rule of subquery:**

The innermost query will be executed first followed by the main query
