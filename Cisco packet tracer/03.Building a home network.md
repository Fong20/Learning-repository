# Building a home network

## Determining the IP Address of an end device
There are generally two ways of searching for the IP address:
- Click on the end device head to the FastEthernet0 tab and search for the IP address at the config tab.
- The subnet mask can also be found in the FastEthernet0 tab.

- Click on the end device and head to the desktop tab, launch the command prompt and type **"ipconfig"**

Note:
The IP Address of an end device will be blured off if the **device requests an IP Address from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server**

There are several types of connections found in cisco packet tracer:
- console

- copper cross over
- fiber

The type of connection to use depends on the device and the connection ports.
Once there is successful connection between two devices, there will be green indicator lights.
