# 06. Network Controllers
- Network Controllers provide a **centralized way to monitor and configure multiple compatible network devices from a single graphical user interface (GUI).**

## General introduction to network controllers
### Function of network controller
- automating device operations
- analyze network operations

### Features of network controller
Provisioning tab = Access to all devices connected to the network
Assurance tab = Quick look of the network health

## Manage and configure network using a network controller
### Accessing the network controller
- Firstly, Connect the network controller to the switch.
- We can then access the Network Controller interface by connecting a web browser to the IP address of the Network Controller management interface.
 
### Create a credential list
In order for the controller to discover devices on the network, it must know the credentials to use to access the devices. You must create a credentials list that will enable the controller to access the devices. 

In order to add a new credential list:
- Head to the dashboard, click provisioning and select the CREDENTIALS tab to add a new credentials list for discovering the devices on the network.

### Create a discovery process
After creating a new credential list, we need to create a discovery process to discover the devices in the network.

Head to the Dashboard Menu, click Provisioning and click the DISCOVERY tab to discover devices on the local network.

In the New Discovery window, use CDP as the Discovery Type. Enter Office - LAN as the name of this process. Enter 0.0.0.0 as the IP address so the controller will discover all the IP addresses on the local network. Select student - Student Profile as the CLI Credential List. Leave all other values as the default. Click ADD to continue.
