# 05. Clustering devices and editing topologies

## 5.1 Creating and deleting clusters
As a topology becomes larger and more complicated, clustering devices lets you combine devices into a single cloud icon to simplify the appearance of the topology.

To create a cluster, select the components you wish to cluster and click on the cloud sign on the top right hand side.

To uncluster a group of devices, highlight the cloud icon and delete it with the Delete tool, by choosing the uncluster option. 

## 5.2 Editing and annotating a topology

### Annotate a device in the network topology

To add a note to annotate a device in the network topology, we can click the note symbol on the top left hand side. To delete the note, simply click on the delete tool and click on the note.

### Adding shapes 
We can also add shapes such as rectangle and oval shapes to distinguish diffirent areas in the network topology.

Once we click on the shape button, a palette dialog appears which allows us to edit the shape. We can edit the shape by providing an outline for the shape or filling it with color.
