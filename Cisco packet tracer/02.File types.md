# 0.2 Packet tracer file types

There are four types of files which can be found in Cisco packet tracer and each of these files have different purposes.

## .pka file type
- It is a packet tracer activity file. The word "a" in .pka represents the word activity.
- Contains two networks, initial network and answer network.
- Initial network opens when the activity is launched whereas the answer network runs in the background which can be used to provide scoring and feedback to learners.
- The answer network is not accessible to the user.

## .pkt file type
- It is created when a simulated network is created and saved in packet tracer.
- It supports background images
- However, it does not have instructions window or activity scoring.

## .pksz file type
- It is specific to the **Cisco Packet Tracer Tutored Activity (PTTA).**
- It consists of .pka file, media assets, and a scripting file for the hinting system.

## .pkz file type
- It was used to embed images and other files. However, images can be embedded in .pka and .pkt files which makes .pkz file deprecated.
