## 4.1 Structured cabling
Structured cabling is performed to ensure that the cables in the workspace is organized. In cisco packet tracer, we can use wall mounts, color-coded cables, and create bendpoints to organize network cabling in a realistic way.

### Patch panel
- Patch panel **provides a location to organize cables installed to the wiring closet.** It works by connecting the cable from the swtich to the patch panel.
- There are two types of patch panel, copper and fiber.

### Wall mount
- Wall mounts are normally used to connect cables to the devices
- There are two types of wall mount, copper and fiber.

### Changing the color of the cables (color coding cables)
- By color coding, we are able to identify the type of cables used for the network based on its color.
- We can change the color of the cable by **right clickling on the cable** and selecting the option **color cable**

### Creating bend points
We can create bend points to organize the cable by right clicking on the cable and selecting create bend points.

## 4.2 Connecting devices using wireless technology


## 4.3 Device configuration using CLI (command line interface)

### Accessing the CLI of a switch/router using terminal application on the Laptop/PC
- **Connect the device to the switch/router using a console connection.** Console connections are made between a laptop or computer and the networking device using a cable designed to provide a direct cable connection. In this Packet Tracer activity, the cable is identified as Console and is shown as a light blue cable.
- Click to the PC/laptop and **head to the device tab and click on the terminal application.** **Accept the default configuration and press OK.**
- A terminal console will be displayed.

### Accessing Privileged EXEC mode to view configuration information
Accessing Privileged EXEC mode allows us to access more network configuration options.

At the Switch> prompt, enter a question mark (?) and press ENTER. A list of commands that are available in User EXEC mode will be displayed.

To enable the Privilege EXEC mode, type **enable** at the prompt and press ENTER.

### Entering global configuration mode
To configure information to the device, we need to enter global configuration mode by **entering the command configure terminal and press ENTER.**

### Saving updated configuration 
If the configuration changes are not saved, they will be lost if the device loses power or is intentionally rebooted. When a Cisco IOS devices starts, it reads the configuration file that is permanent memory and loads it into the running configuration in RAM. Configuration changes are only made to the running configuration. The changes must be saved so that they will become available to a device on startup.

To save the updated configuration, Use the **copy running-config startup-config** command to **save the current configuration running on the device to the startup configuration that will load when the device powers up.** Press ENTER to accept the default filename.

To** verify that the configuration changes were saved properly,** reload the device using the **reload** command. Press ENTER to proceed. **Reloading the router will reboot the IOS software and IOS will load the saved configuration file.** If the new configuration was made and saved in permanent memory, the device will prompt you for a password to access the device console.

Press ENTER when the message Press RETURN to get started! appears. If the configuration was saved successfully, the User Access Verification message will be displayed.
