# 02. System Models
- Conceptual model intended to provide an abstract, simplified but consistent description of a relevant aspect of distributed system design
- It is basically a graphical representation on how the system works. 

Types of conceptual models
1. Architectural model
2. Fundamental model

### Architectural model
- Provides a high level view of the distribution of functionality between components and the relationships (communication pattern) between 
them.
- Determines the distribution of data and the computational tasks amongst  the physical nodes of the system.
- Helpful when evaluating properties such as performance, reliability, scalability

square / circle = components
lines represent the interaction / relationship between the systems 

1. DISPEL Architecture

2. Layered architecture
-  Used for client-server system
-  Each layer is in charge of dealing with the the following layers

3. Object-based architecture
   
4. Malaysian Open Science Platform Architecture (MOSP)
- MOSP harvest the metadata from the institutional repository

  harvest the metadata

  registry saves the metadata

5. Event-based architecture
- waits for specific event to happen instead of action from user
- Used in event-driven systems, e.g. sensor network, traffic congestion  control trading systems, whose execution is response to the arrival of 
events
- asynchronous message-passing rather than request-reply

Example: Ticketing System which produces tickets once vehicles run the red light

6. Shared data-space architecture
- Processes are decoupled in space and time
- data publishers post items to shared space; data consumers pick up at a later time

### Centralized architecture
Client-server Model:
It is a 2 tier model
- There are processes offering services (servers) 
- There are processes that use services (clients) 
- Clients and servers can be on different machines 
- Clients follow request/reply model to using services

### Multi-tiered architecture
- Basically consists of more than 2 tiers
- If the client side is strong, the application and database can also be incorporated in the client side instead of the server side

Example: 

a) is used  in remote control

d) is used in iq air

Example: 3 tier architecture
