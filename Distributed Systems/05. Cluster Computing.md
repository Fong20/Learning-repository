# 05. Cluster Computing
- A group of interconnected computers (nodes) working together as a single powerful system, creating a unified computing resource far greater than the sum of its parts.
- By pooling resources, clusters enable high-performance computing capabilities that transform how we approach complex problems. The high performance, eg:Infiband allows the multiple computers to function as a single computer.
- This architecture provides the foundation for tackling intricate scientific challenges that single machines simply cannot handle efficiently or economically.

embarassingly parallel problem =  problem that is easily broken down into many independent tasks that can be processed simultaneously with little to no communication or dependency between them

## Components of Cluster Computing

### 1. Compute Nodes
- Individual computers equipped with CPUs/GPUs, memory, and local storage, forming the processing backbone

### 2. High-Speed Network
- InfiniBand or Ethernet interconnects enable rapid communication between nodes with minimal latency

### 3. Resource Manager / Cluster scheduler
- Orchestrates job distribution, monitors system health, and optimises resource allocation across the cluster
- Schedulers are the intelligent orchestrators of cluster computing, managing job queues, allocating resources, and strategically assigning tasks to nodes based on availability and priority.
- Their primary objectives include maximisingcluster utilisation, minimisinguser wait times, andensuring fair access across multiple research teams and projects.
- Modern schedulers elegantly handle diverse workloads—from quick interactive tasks and long-running batch jobs to always-on services—whilst adapting to changing demands in real time.

### 4. Shared Storage
- Distributed file systems provide unified access to data, ensuring all nodes can retrieve and store information efficiently

## Uses of Cluster Computing

### 1. Climate Modelling
- Accelerates complex simulations predicting weather patterns and climate change scenarios decades into the future

### 2. Genomics Research
- Processes vast genetic datasets to unlock the secrets of disease, evolution, and personalisedmedicine

### 3. Astrophysics
- Analyses petabytes of cosmic data from observatories, revealing the universe's deepest mysteries
