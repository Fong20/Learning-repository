# 03. Cloud Computing
Defined as the computing capabilities such as services, software, or infrastructure that are deivered via the internet technologies to the user in a pay-per-use, self-service way

The services are:
- uniform (functions similar in all platforms)
- on-demand 
- available at all time (available whenever the user requires it)
- on a “pay as you go” basis (user is charged based on the amount of usage)
- scalable = able to support increasing amount of users
- elastic / configurable = able to be configured to meet the user's specific requirement

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### 1. Resource Pooling
- Computing resources which can be shared / pooled among multiple users using multi-tenant model
- dynamically assigned and reassigned resources according to consumer demand
- dynamically scalable according to needs
- analogy: bus vs car. The higher capacity, higher utilisation, lower cost


### 2. Broad network access
- off premises: resources are available over the network
- can be accessed by multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops
- e.g. Google Drive. user can upload a document using the desktop in the office, and access it back at home using iPad.

### 3. On-demand self-service
- user can provision the resources, such as server time and storage, as needed without requiring human intervention
- resources can be used as necessary and only when necessary
- e.g. AWS EC2. user can initiate any number of virtual servers at anytime of the day, through the user-friendly portal

### 4. Measure service
- Cloud systems automatically control and optimise resource use by leveraging a metering capability on a pay-per-use basis.
- Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilised service.
- e.g. in the AWS, user can set usage alarm on the virtual server, which will automatically send out an notification email to the user. User will receive an itemised bill each month.

### 5. Rapid elasticity
- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
- To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
1. Convenience
- User can access documents from any devices (your desktop, laptop and your smartphone) anywhere and anytime

2. Simplicity
- There is no need to install complex software (well, a simple client program is expected for some services, such as dropbox)
- There is no need to worry about wether the hosting server is running or not

3. lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- includes direct and indirect cost of the IT systems such as:
- computer hardware and software, e.g. purchasing study, installation and integration, licensing, warranties, migration expenses, and risks
- operations expenses, e.g. infrastructure (building), electricity (power up and cooling), downtime and failure, backup and recovery, security, and training
- long-term expenses, e.g. replacement, upgrading, and decommissioning

4. increase availability and reliability
- 24/7 availability
- Example: 99.999999999% durability of Amazon S3. This corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects.
- e.g. if you store 10,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000,000 year

5. Elastic and on-demand
- easily scalable and pay-as-you-go

## Cloud delivery model
- Refers to a specific, pre-packaged combination of IT resources offered by a cloud provider.
- Each model will have a consumer and provider

three common cloud delivery models have become widely established and formalised:
- Infrastructure-as-a-Services (IaaS)
- Platform-as-a-Services (PaaS)
- Software-as-a-Services (SaaS)

### 1. Infrastructure as a service
- hardware is provided by the cloud provider
- the IT resources are generally not pre-configured
- this placing the administrative responsibility directly upon cloud consumer
- used by cloud consumers that require a high level of control over their cloud-based infrastructure

### 2. Platform as a service
- a predefined ready-to-use environment comprises already deployed and configured IT resources.
- relied on the usage of a ready-made environment. It establishes a set of pre-packaged products and tools to support the delivery life-cycle of custom applications

### 3. Software as a service
a software program positioned as a shared cloud service and made available as a product or generic utility
•
used to make a reusable cloud service widely available to a range of cloud consumer
•
the entire marketplace exists around SaaS products can be leased and used for different purposes via different terms

cloud consumers are granted limited administrative control over SaaS implementation
•
a PaaS cloud consumer can use the development environment to build a SaaS and made available to other cloud consumers
-
a PaaS cloud consumer become cloud providers

## Cloud Deployment Model
represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access.

there are four common cloud deployment models:
- public clouds
- community clouds
- private clouds
- hybrid clouds

### Public Cloud
- publicly accessible cloud environment owned by third party cloud provider
- generally offered to cloud consumer at a cost
- cloud provider is responsible for the creation and on-going maintenance of the cloud and its IT infrastructure
- e.g. AWS and Salesforce

### Private Cloud
- owned by a single organisation
- use cloud computing technology to provide centralised access to IT resources by all parts of the organisation
- the same organisation is technically both the cloud consumer and cloud provider
- e.g. eBay Cloud, sunway university SET providing cloud services to different school

### Hybrid Cloud
- a cloud environment comprised of two or more different cloud deployment models
- deploy cloud services processing sensitive data to a private cloud and other, less sensitive cloud services to a public cloud
