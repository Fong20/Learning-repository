# 01. Introduction to Distributed Systems
- Distributed system is defined as a collection of devices or components which are connected to the network and communicate through message parsing.
- It appears to the users of the system as a single computer. It is equipped with software that enables computers to coordinate their
activities and to share resources (Eg: hardware, software, and data)

Example: web browsers, world wide web, credit card transaction systems

## Characteristics of distributed system

### 1. Concurrency of components
- Supports simultaneous task execution and resource sharing among multiple executing programs

### 2. Lack of global clock
- There is no single, universal clock across all nodes, leading to asynchronous operations and varying speeds of execution. 

#### Factors contributing to the lack of global clock
- Physics of Light: Messages cannot travel faster than the speed of light, which introduces unavoidable delays in a distributed environment.
- Independent Clocks: Each computer node has its own physical clock, and these clocks inevitably run at different rates or "drift".
- Communication Delays: The time it takes for messages to travel between nodes makes it impossible for all nodes to ever have the exact same time at any given moment. 

### 3. Independent failure of components
- Supports fault tolerance. Each component can fail independently without affecting the working of other components.

## Components of fistributed system

### 1. Independent computers
- Eg: desktops, laptops, handheld devices, and sensors

### 2. Middleware
- Software that acts as the bridge between the operating system and application, which allows the computers to communicate and share resources in a unified environment. Hence, it allows the devices to work as it is a single system.

## Factors contributing to the need for distributed system
- Ever increasing need to SHARE resources and information
- Widely use of sensor and mobile instruments
- Rapid decreasing cost of powerful workstations
- Widespread use of networks
- Maturity of software technology

## Goals of Distributed System

### 1. Efficiency
- Distributed systems should have fast Communication and efficient Load Distribution

### 2. Flexibility
- From the users viewpoint, the system must have ease of use, consistency, and reliability
- From the systems viewpoint, the systems should support modularity (support multiple types of devices and OS, scalability, portability, interoperability

### 3. Consistency
- A system is consistent if there is uniformity in using the system and the system behaviour is predictable.
- Integrity of the system must be maintained with proper concurrency control
- Inconsistency can be due to lack of global info, potential replication and partitioning of data, possibility of component failures or complexity of
interaction among modules

### 4. Robustness
- The system must be able to handle exceptional situations and errors, ex: changes in topology, long message delays, inability to locate servers.
- Should include security, reliability, protection and access control

## Challenges of Distributed System

### 1.Heterogeneity (variety and difference)
- system must be able to support different network, OS, programming language, data format etc

### 2. Openness
- Refers to the degree in which the program is able to adapt to the change in hardware and software
- refers to the ability to be extended and improved using standard, well-defined interfaces that allow for the integration of new hardware and software components from various vendors. 

### 3. Security
- System must be safe
- Satisfy the CIA Triad, confidentiality, integrity, and availability

### 4. Scalability
- System must remain effective when there is a significant increase in the number of resources and the number of users. eg. Internet.

#### Scalable components
- Number of users and/or processes (size scalability)
- Maximum distance between nodes (geographical scalability)
- Number of administrative domains (administrative scalability)

**Techniques for scaling:**

Hide communication latencies
- Avoid waiting for responses; do something else:
• Make use of asynchronous communication
• Have separate handler for incoming response
• Distribution
- Partition data and computations across multiple machines:
• Move computations to clients (Java applets)
• Decentralised naming services (DNS)
• Replication/caching
- Make copies of data available at different machines:
• Mirrored Web sites
• Web caches (in browsers and proxies)

### 5. Failure handling
- It is inevitable that computer systems will fail. Thus, system must be able to handle unexpected system failures

#### Techniques for handling failure
- Detecting failure – use checksums.
- Masking failures – hidden the failure (eg. retransmission, backup
storage).
- Tolerating failures.
- Recovery from failures.
- Redundancy.
  
### 6. Concurrency
- allows clients to access a share resources at the same time.
- Any object (services/applications) that represents a shared resource in a DS must be responsible for ensuring that it operates correctly in a concurrent
environment.

### 7. Transparency
- conceal complex opearations and the components of distributed system from the user
