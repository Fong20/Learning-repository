# Knowledge-based Agent and Propositional Logic
Knowledge representation is a field dedicated to represent the knowledge of the world to allow a computational unit to understand and solve problems.

## Knowledge based agents
- A knowledge-based agent makes decision based on its knowledge base (KB).
- A knowledge base is a set of sentences (not “sentences” in the sense of English or natural languages) that represents the understanding of the world.
- Eg: agentic ai (ai without chatbot capabilities)

- When an agent is initiated, the KB might be empty or containing some background knowledge.
- Inference will happen from time to time to derive new sentence from old.

Knowledge comes from your understanding of the particular topic

## PEAS description
Knowledge can be represented through PEAS

Components of PEAS
1. Performance measure
2. Environment
3. Actuators (action)
4. Sensor (how the agent perceive the environment)

**Example: Wumpus World**

## Logic
- Logic is a systematic representation of information and knowledge to be communicated to machine.
- Logic is expressed using specific **syntax** of the representation language to define the **semantics** of the sentences.

**Important terms**
- syntax – to identify if an expression is well-formed
- semantics – to identify the meaning of an expression

### Semantics
- Semantics defines the meaning of the sentences within the world the language is defined in.
- In standard logics, a sentence must be true or false, no “in between” is allowed.

**Examples:**
-  “x + y = 4” is true in a world where x is 2 and y is 2
-   x + y = 4” is false in a world where x is 1 and y is 1

### Syntax 
- Syntax defines how an expression (statement) can be formed. A correctly formed statement has a meaning within the definition of the language.

**Examples: (assuming p and q are facts, x and y are numbers)**
- p
- p ∧ q
- x4y+ =
- 3x + y
- 3x + y > 2

propositional logic = fuzzy logic

### Propositional logic

**1. Atomic sentences**
- Atomic sentences are simple sentences consist of a single proposition symbol. Such symbol stands for a proposition that can be true or false.

**Examples:**
- A
- True
- W1,3

**2. Complex sentences**
- Complex sentences are sentences constructed from **simpler sentences using parentheses and logical connectives**

**Examples:**
- ¬A
- ¬(A ∧ B)
- (A ∨ B) ∧ C

Implications
- also known as if soemthing is (true), then something (true)

### Entailment


### Inference
- Inference is the process of deriving entailments from the Knowledge Base.
- a sound inference algorithm derives only entailed sentences.
-  an unsound inference procedure makes things up.

### First Order Logic  (true false logic)
- First order logic (FOL) is also called predicate logic due to the addition of predicate
variables.

FOL adds three concepts to the syntax on top of those in propositional logic,
1. predicate variables,
2. universal quantifier ∀, and
3. existential quantifier ∃.
