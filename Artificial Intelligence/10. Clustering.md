# 10. Clustering
- A type of unsupervised learning
- Clustering group objects into clusters (groups of objects) such that an object is more similar to other objects in the same cluster than the objects in other clusters.
- clustering algorithm determines which object should be put in the same group as which object

## K-means clustering
- A form of centroid-based clustering
- Eg: finding the centroids that best separates the data into k groups.

**Process:**
1. define the value of k, i.e. the number of clusters to be separated into
2. randomly choose k points from the dataset and assign them as the centroids
3. calculate the distance from each point to each centroid (we normally use euclidean distance)
4. the points are grouped according to the nearest centroid
5. new centroids (means) are calculated from the grouped points
6. repeat from step 3 until,the change in centroids is small or the centroids are oscillating

## Evaluation of clustering
1. minimum within-cluster (intra-group) variation
2. maximum between-cluster (inter-group) variation

between cluster = occurs when there is a in between of custers

“Good” clusters would have small within-cluster variation and large between-cluster
variation.

It is easier to calculate within cluster variation if we have smaller dataset

## Pseudo-F statistics
- Is used to maximise between-clusters variation and minimise within-clusters variation
- The higher the value of F is, the better the clustering solution is.

## Best k
To identify the best value of k, for different values of k, we can follow these few steps:
1. perform k-means clustering,
2. calculate the pseudo-F statistics
3. plot the graph of pseudo-F against k
4. identify the best k with the “elbow”-method

## Feature scaling / Normalisation
Normalisation is used when threre are two different clustering features
1. min-max normalisation

Xs = xi − min(x) / max(x) − min(x)

2. mean-centred
   
Xs = xi − mean(x)

3. standardisation

Xs = xi − mean(x) / stddev(x)
