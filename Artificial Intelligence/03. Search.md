# 03. Search
Search is the process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches the goal.

## Goal
- Goal limits the objectives to achieve and hence the actions to consider.
- Given a goal, the process of problem formulation is to decide the **actions** and **states** to
be used in the problem.

## State
- represents the current condition / situation

## Actions
- Defined as the steps taken to acheive the goal

## Solution
- Defined as a sequence of actions performed to reach the goal from the starting state
- A solution to a problem is an action sequence that leads from the initial state to the goalstate
- An optimal solution is the “best” solution among all solutions.
For

## State space
- is the representation of a problem whereby possible alternative paths leading to a solution can be explored and analysed.
- is constructed with all possible states and actions.
- starting point to creating an algorithm

## Transition model
- is the description of the actions.
- is a function to map one state to another state given an action.
f(current state, action) = next state

## Real-world problems
1. route-finding problems – as the one of Nick in Romania
2. touring problems – visit every point at least once, starting and ending in a specific city
3. traveling salesperson problem (TSP) – a touring problem with each point must be visited exactly only once
4. VLSI layout problem – to position millions of components and connections on a chip to minimise area, maximise production,... . . .
5. robot navigation – a more general route-finding problem

## Process of solving problem using search
To solve the problem using search, we need to go through the following process:

Step 1: Goal formulation
Step 2: Problem formulation
Step 3: Solution identification

## Search algorithms
Different search algorithms are useful to identify optimal solutions with different criteria of “best”.

### Five components 
- Initial state = the state the agent starts in
- Actions – the actions available to the agent
- Transition model – description of what each action does
- Goal test – a test to determine if a given state is a goal state
- Path cost – calculate numerical cost of a path (a series of actions) to reflect performance measure

### Types of search algorithms
1. Uninformed search = not given any information
2. Informed search
3. same search
