# 03. Search
Search is the process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches the goal.

## Goal
- Goal limits the objectives to achieve and hence the actions to consider.
- Given a goal, the process of problem formulation is to decide the **actions** and **states** to be used in the problem.

## State
- represents the current condition / situation

## Actions
- Defined as the steps taken to acheive the goal

## Solution
- Defined as a sequence of actions performed to reach the goal from the starting state
- A solution to a problem is an action sequence that leads from the initial state to the goalstate
- An optimal solution is the “best” solution among all solutions.

## State space
- is the representation of a problem whereby possible alternative paths leading to a solution can be explored and analysed.
- is constructed with all possible states and actions.
- starting point to creating an algorithm

## Transition model
- Defined as the description of each actions.
- is a function to map one state to another state given an action.

f(current state, action) = next state

## Additional Important terms
- Root node / Parent node = starting node
- leaf node = nodes which do not have children
- Frontier node = nodes which are explored and to be expanded

## Real-world problems
1. route-finding problems – as the one of Nick in Romania
2. touring problems – visit every point at least once, starting and ending in a specific city
3. traveling salesperson problem (TSP) – a touring problem with each point must be visited exactly only once
4. VLSI layout problem – to position millions of components and connections on a chip to minimise area, maximise production,... . . .
5. robot navigation – a more general route-finding problem

## Process of solving problem using search
To solve the problem using search, we need to go through the following process:

Step 1: Goal formulation
Step 2: Problem formulation
Step 3: Solution identification

## Search algorithms
Different search algorithms are useful to identify optimal solutions with different criteria of “best”.

### Five components 
- Initial state = the state the agent starts in
- Actions – the actions available to the agent
- Transition model – description of what each action does
- Goal test – a test to determine if a given state is a goal state
- Path cost – calculate numerical cost of a path (a series of actions) to reflect performance measure

### Types of search algorithms
1. Uninformed search 
2. Informed search
3. same search

## Uninformed Search
- also known as blind search because there's no additional information provided.
- It uses strategies with no additional information beyond the problem's definition.

### Types of Uninformed Search
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
  
### Breadth-first search (BFS)

**How it works:**
1. Expand root node
2. Expand all successors of root node at the **same level**
3. Continue expanding the successors of the successors

**Note:**
- If there exist redundant nodes in the same level, remove the child node which is found later

- As the goal is reached, the algorithm ends

### Depth-first search (DFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS) expands the deepest node in the current frontier of the search tree.
- The nodes on the left regardless of each level is always the first node for the particular level.

#### Types of depth-first search 
1. Depth-limited search
- A depth limit is imposed. Nodes at the depth limit are treated as having no successors.

2. Iterative deepening depth-first search
- Iteratively changes the depth limit in order to find the shallowest depth to reach the goal.

#### Example: Reach node M using DFS

The nodes on the left regardless of each level is always the first node for the particular level. In this case, it is B,D and H.

The explored nodes which do not match the goal will be eliminated

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb8d32f-cc39-44ff-85ea-f114a4f33200)

Since all the child nodes of D do not fulfill the goal and has been eliminated, we look to another child node of B which is E

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4f27138-cf8c-4d29-af16-b5c09841a5ee)

Node E has child nodes of J and K.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8256e3-96cb-4c2f-a080-118e931523ac)

Since the child node J do not fulfill the goal, it is eliminated and we move to check child node K

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d88ec0-ad2e-4879-9e2a-07ce2ce7c4da)

Since all the child nodes of B do not fulfill the goal and has been eliminated, we look to another child node of A which is C

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c4ce81-64d7-4736-9d2b-0fc2299eb449)

Node C has child nodes of F and G

Start by checking the first node of the level which if node L

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c73752-2fe6-402f-b50e-207f8d7d60eb)

Since the child node L do not fulfill the goal, it is eliminated and we move to check child node M. Since node M is the goal, the algorithm stops.

### Uniform cost search (UCS)

**How it works:**
1. Expand on nodes based on the cost (from the lowest to highest)
2. When a redundant path exists, the path with a higher path cost is removed.
3. If there exist redundant nodes in the same level, remove the child node which have higher total cost (path cost)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2906c49f-e072-48c2-b310-b10dfa17cdd1)

#### BFS vs UCS
1. UCS expand on nodes based on the cost (from the lowest to highest) while BFS expand on the shallowest node
2. UCS uses priority queue based on path cost in frontier while BFS USES FIFO queue in frontier
3. In UCS, the algorithm does not end and will continue to find lower costs to reach the goal while the algorithm will end once the goal is reached in BFS

**Example: Using UCS to find the path from Arad to Bucharest**

## Informed search (heuristic search)
- An informed search algorithm, also known as a heuristic search, is a type of search algorithm that leverages additional information about the state space of a problem to efficiently find a solution.
-  This additional information, typically in the form of a heuristic function, helps estimate the cost or distance from a given node in the search space to the goal node.
-  heuristics are strategies derived from the previous experiences with similar problems
- e.g. a rule of thumb, common sense, an intuitive judgment

### Types of Informed search
1. Greedy-best first search
2. A* search

### Greedy best first search
- expands the node that is closest to the goal
- a heuristic function is therefore used to estimate the distance from the node to the goal
- In greedy best-first search, only the heuristic function h(n) is used to form the evaluation, function f(n)
- note that this estimated distance is not meant to be accurate

f(n) = h(n), where f(n) is the evaluation function and h(n) is the heuristic function

**How it works**
- The algorithm starts at the initial node and evaluates its neighbors.
- It chooses the neighbor with the lowest heuristic value h(n) and continues the process.

**Advantages**
- Less computational effort as compared to BFS. It just looks for the shortest distance to the goal and ignore the rest of the paths

### A* Search
- A* search is another variant of best-first search that uses not only the estimated cost from the current node to the goal node, but also the known cost from start node to current node.
- A* evaluates nodes based on the sum of the path cost and the heuristic estimate.
- The algorithm ensures that the path found is both the shortest and most cost-effective, provided that the heuristic function is admissible (it never overestimates the actual cost).

**Formula:**

f(n) = g(n) + h(n) , where

- g(n) is the path cost from the start node to node n
- h(n) is the estimated cheapest cost (heuristic function) of node n to the goal node
- f(n) is the estimated cheapest path cost of the solution through node n

**How it works**
- It functions similar to greedy best first search where it chooses the nodes at each of the layer with the lowest straight line distance to the goal and expanding on it. The only difference is there is an addition of the cost of the node to the goal node.

#### Admissable heuristic
- A heuristic is said to be admissable when it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, i.e. optimistic
- The actual path cost to reach goal through node n is higher than the cost estimated by heuristic function h(n)
- h(n) ≤ g(n, a, n′) + h(n′)

Thus, A* search is said to be optimal if h(n) is an admissible heuristic

## Non-deterministic environment
Non-deterministic environment can be described as an action applied on a state which leads to multiple possible states

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d20ae5-2ebe-48ff-8905-a2f710dfc6bb)

## And-or tree
- There are several branching in a search tree
- introduced by agent’s choice of action – OR node
- introduced by environment’s choice of outcome – AND node

## Game Search (Adverserial Search)
- introduces an adversary in the problem; an adversary is one who try to impede the advancement
- Search algorithm which is applied to multiagent environment
- Simplest explanation is a two-player game in which one player tries to maximise the winning chance while minimise the winning chance of the other player.

### Game tree
- A game tree is a visual representation of all possible sequences of moves, decisions, and outcomes in a game
- The nodes represent the game's state while the edges represents the moves available at each state

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550d3483-2609-40de-8562-ba34d0af8dd1)

### Minimax algorithm
- As the rule of thumb is to increase the chance to win against the opponent, a heuristic function is needed to measure if a state is more advantageous for one player or the other.
- However, expanding the whole game tree to identify the best next move results in **combinatorial explosion.**
- **Combinatorial explosion** refers to the **rapid increase in complexity and the number of possible combinations that can arise from a given set of elements as the size of the set grows.**
- Thus, Minimax algorithm expands the game tree up to a number of moves and evaluates the goodness of the moves based on the leaf nodes.

#### Formula to calculate heuristic function
Scenario: Calculate the heuristic function for Tic-tac toe. In this case, it will evaluate the goodness of the state towards x

E(x) = N(x) - N(o)

- N(x) as the number of rows, columns, and diagonals that x could win
- N(o) as the number of rows, columns, and diagonals that o could win
- E(x) = heuristic function

Example: N(x) = 2 and N(o) = 3, ∴ E(x) = 2 − 3 = −1

#### How it works
1. Calculate E(X) for the leaf nodes
2. Find the minimum value of E(x) for each branch
3. Move the minimum values to the max level and find the maximum value E(x) by comparing the values of each branch, The maximum value of E(x) would be the move Player x would choose

**Example: Tic-tac toe**

### Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Improves the efficiency of minimax algorithm by reducing the branches to be expanded in a game tree while obtaining the same results
- This is achieved by using alpha and beta values
- alpha is the lowest possible value of the node
- beta is the highest possible value of the node

### How it works
- Beta value is obtained by getting the minimum value of the branch
- Once the beta value is obtained, compare all the values of the branch and get the minimum value of the branch

Note: pruning must be finished for the first branch before moving to another
