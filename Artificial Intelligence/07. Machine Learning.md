# 07. Machine Learning
a computer program that Learns the underlying pattern from the data to make further decision.

## Areas of machine learning
1. Supervised learning = learning of a topic with proven information
2. Unsupervised learning = learning of a topic without proven information
3. Reinforcement learning = combination of supervised and unsupervised learning

## Pmachine learning problem
- Initial model is created
- Data is provided and analyzed using training algorithm
- Trained model is created

### Supervised learning
- trains the machine learning model using data with known output/target values.
- data consists of input features and target values.
- the training algorithm updates the parameters in the model based on the differences between the target and the predicted values.

### Unsupervised learning
- trains the machine learning model using data with no known outout/target values.
- often used for pattern recognition, i.e. to infer patterns from the dataset without having a reference.

### Reinforcement learning
- often used to learn the ‘best’ way to carry out a process by providing rewards or punishments when the actions are carried out.
- for example, to learn the best moves to win a game. The model comes up with a sequence of moves to play a game. At the end of each game, the game result (win or lose) can be used as a reward or punishment to identify that the current sequence of moves should be promoted or
discouraged.

## Important concepts towards creating a machine learning model
- Bias = how far the prediction is from the actual value. This occurs whenever we  provide too much data for the model (overfit)
- Variance = Sensitivity of the model towards noise. This occurs whenever we do not provide enough data for the model (underfit)
- Underfitting is the situation in which the model is unable to solve learnt examples and generalise due to the lack of learning.
- Underfitting is the situation in which the model is unable to solve learnt examples and generalise due to the lack of learning. Overfitting is the situation in which the model has high accuracy in solving learnt examples but unable to generalise due to over training.
- An ideal model must have low bias and low variance. This means that it must be able to generate a accurate and consistent answer. This can be acheived by acheiving good fit, avoiding underfitting or overfitting
