# 06. Knowledge Representation

## Types of knowledge
1. Declarative and procedural knowledge
- Declarative knowledge – knowledge of facts
- Procedural knowledge – knowledge of how to do things

2. Tacit and explicit knowledge
- Tacit knowledge – cannot be articulated easily
- Explicit knowledge – can be articulated easily

3. Generic and specific knowledge
- Generic knowledge – applies across many situations
- Specific knowledge – applies to one or a few situations

## Knowledge representation schemes
1. Ontologies
2. Semantic network
3. Frames
4. Semantic Web

### Ontology
- represent a shared domain by utilising a common vocabulary
- to describe the classes, relations, functions, and other objects of interest

#### Components of ontologies
- individuals
- classes (
- attributes
- relations
- function terms
- restrictions
- rules (statements in the form of if-then sentence)
- axioms
- events

#### Individuals
- known as instances, objects
- They are also known as the basic, “ground level” components of an ontology
- concrete objects – people, animals, tables, molecules, . . .
- abstract objects – numbers, words, . . .
- an ontology do not need to include any individuals
- an ontology provides a mean to classify individuals, even if the individuals are not explicitly part of the ontology


#### Classes
- also called type, sort, category, kind
▶ extensional and intensional definition
extensional – abstract groups, sets, or collections of objects
intensional – abstract object that are defined by the features of the class
▶ examples:
Person – the class of all people
– abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a person
Vehicle – the class of all vehicles
– the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a
vehicle
Car – the class of all cars
– the abstract object that can be described by the criteria for being a ca

Subsumption relation
- the concept of inheritance follows the subsumption relation

Example:
class A subsumes class B
class A is a superclass (or supertype)
class B is a subclass (or subtype)
all members of a subclass are members of the subclass’s superclass
for example, Vehicle subsumes Car

#### Attributes
- objects in an ontology can be described by relating them to other things (attributes)

#### Relationship
- specify how objects are related to other objects

  Instance off = relation between class and individual

  mereology relation (part-off relationship) = represents how objects combine together to form composite objects
