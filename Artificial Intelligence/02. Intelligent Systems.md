## Expert system
- a software which mimics the human mind in making decisions and solving problems
- utilizes knowledge base and inference engine to make decisions

### Components of an expert system
- Knowledge base = information set
- Inference engine = makes inferece based on few inference rules
- User interface

### Inference methods
There are two methods in rule-based systems
- forward chaining
- backward chaining

#### Forward chaining
The rules are executed in forward motion, begin from the data to acheive the goal

#### Backward chaining
Starts with a list of goals. The rules are executed in backward motion, to see if it supports the goal

## Production system
- a subset of expert system
- works through if-then rules (situation-action system)

Components of a production system
- knowledge base
- working memory
- inference engine
- control strategy

### Metaknowledge
- Defined as knowledge about a domain that is useful in specific situations where one might identify a problem

## Expert system vs Production system

## Uncertainity
- Refers to ambiguous / unclear conditions which affectt the AI's operation
- Approaches to solve such issue are probability theories (Bayesian reasoning, Hidden Markov Model) and Certainty factors theory (fuzzy logic and fuzzy systems)
