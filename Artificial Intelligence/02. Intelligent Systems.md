# 02. Intelligent Systems
Intelligent systems are systems that are designed to solve complex problems and make decisions that would typically require human intelligence.

## Types of Intelligent Systems
1. Pre-Gen AI Systems
2. Gen-AI Systems
   
## Pre-Gen AI systems
- In Pre-Gen AI systems, the knowledge is encoded in the form of rules, facts or heuristics and the system rely on them to make decisions.
- Eg: Expert systems, Production Systems

### Expert systems
- Expert system is defined as an intelligent system which mimics the human mind in making decisions and solving problems in regards to a specific domain
- It utilizes knowledge base and inference engine to make decisions
- Eg: MYCIN, DENDRAL

### Components of an expert system
1. **Knowledge base**
- The knowledge base is the heart of the system. It contains all the information and rules based on the specific domain which are built by domain experts.
- The accuracy and completeness of the knowledge base directly impact the system’s performance. If the knowledge is outdated or incomplete, the system’s recommendations may be flawed.

2. **Inference engine**
- The inference engine is the brain of the expert system. It takes the current input and applies the rules in the knowledge base to produce an output / make conclusions or decision
- The inference engine uses several inference methods such as forward chaining or backward chaining to analyze data and apply rules.

3. **User interface**
- The platform which allows the user to interact with the system, by providing an input while the system processes the input and provides an output

4. **Explanation Module / Facilities**
- The explanation module explains how the system arrived at a particular conclusion by providing users with a clear, step-by-step explanation of the system’s reasoning.

### How Expert System Works
The working mechanism of an expert system begins when a user submits a query through the user interface.

1. This query is then processed by the inference engine, which applies logical rules and reasoning techniques to analyze the input.
2. The inference engine interacts with the knowledge base, retrieving relevant facts, rules, and heuristics contributed by expert users.
3. Based on this structured knowledge, the system derives conclusions and formulates an appropriate response.

Finally, the expert system provides advice or recommendations to the user, assisting in decision-making or problem-solving without requiring direct human expert intervention.

### Production system 
- Production system refers to a type of rule-based system that is designed to provide a structured approach to problem solving and decision-making.
-  It is known as a subset of expert system. This framework is particularly influential in the realm of expert systems, where it simulates human decision-making processes using a set of predefined rules and facts.
- It works through if-then rules (situation-action system)

### Components of a production system
1. **Knowledge base**
- A collection of domain specific information and if-then rules.

2. **Inference engine**
- Takes the current input and applies the rules in the knowledge base to produce an output / make conclusions or decision

3. **Working memory**
- A dynamic storage that holds the current facts or data that the system will use for reasoning.

4. **Control Strategy / Mechanism**
- This governs the order in which rules are applied by the inference engine and manages the flow of the process. It ensures that the system responds appropriately to changes in the working memory and applies rules effectively to reach conclusions or solutions.

### Relationship between Expert system and Production system
Expert systems often use production systems as the underlying reasoning mechanism. Production systems are simply rule-based systems that can be part of an expert system, enabling the system to reason and deduce conclusions based on the rules in the knowledge base.

### Uncertainity in Expert Systems
- Refers to **ambiguous / unclear** conditions which affect the AI's operation
- Approaches to solve such issue are probability theories (Bayesian reasoning, Hidden Markov Model) and Certainty factors theory (fuzzy logic and fuzzy systems)

## Inferencing methods
There are two inferencing methods which are used in rule-based systems
- forward chaining (data-driven)
- backward chaining (goal-driven)

#### Forward chaining (data driven)
- Start with the available data and apply the rules to infer new facts and work towards a conclusion
- It’s typically used to predict outcomes or determine what will happen next.

#### Backward chaining (goal-driven)
- Start with a goal and work backwards to identify which facts or conditions are needed to achieve the goal
- It’s often used to diagnose issues by determining the cause of an observed effect.

### Limitations of Pre-Gen AI Systems
1. **No self-learning capabilities:**

Pre Gen-AI systems don’t learn from experience. Their knowledge base must be manually created and updated by human    experts. This is a key difference from GenAI systems, which can learn from large datasets and improve over time.

2. **Rigid Decision-Making:**

Pre Gen-AI systems struggle with ambiguous or incomplete data. They are designed to work well within a defined scope but lack flexibility in handling unexpected situations or new information.
