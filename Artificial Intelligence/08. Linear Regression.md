# 08. Regression
- Regression is a machine learning model that estimates the relationships between numerical and continuous variables.
- The purpose of regression is to perform estimation or prediction
- The output / target data is numerical / continuous

**Types of linear regression**
- Linear regression

## Linear regression
- Linear regression uses the linear function to estimate the relationship between the input
- Linear regression must have two values
- The graph produced would be a linear graph

Equation: y = mx + c where y is the dependent variable (output value) and x is the independent variable (input value)

### Goodness of regression line
Loss function / least square method is used to identify the regression line with the best fit. It does so by calculating the cost function between the predicted target values and the actual target values by manipulating the m and c values.

The smaller the cost function value, the better the goodness of the regression line

### Gradient descent
- Gradient descent is an iterative optimisation algorithm to identify the values of the parameters that minimise a cost function.
- The parameters change in the direction of decreasing cost to eventually reach the point of minimum cost.
- Gradient descent is only performed when the cost value, J is not optimal

### Effect of learning rate, alpha on learning process

big alpha = fast learning rate

reasonable alpha = balance learning rate

small alpha = slow training rate
