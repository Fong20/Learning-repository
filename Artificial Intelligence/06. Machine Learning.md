# 06. Machine Learning
Machine learning is defined as a computer program that learns the underlying pattern from the data to make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Decision making process using Machine Learning
1. Identify the decision to make
2. Identify the knowledge required to make the decision
3. Identify how does the knowledge affect the decision making

## Solving problem using machine learning
- Initial model is created
- Data is provided and analyzed using training algorithm
- Trained model is created

## Areas of machine learning
1. Supervised learning = learning of a topic with proven information
2. Unsupervised learning = learning of a topic without proven information
3. Reinforcement learning = combination of supervised and unsupervised learning

### Supervised learning
- Trains the machine learning model using labelled dataset, which means each input has a corresponding output.
- The data consists of input features and target values.
- The training algorithm updates the parameters in the model based on the differences between the target and the predicted values.

### Unsupervised learning
- Trains the machine learning model using data with no predefined labels, which means it has no output/target values.
- It is often used for pattern recognition, i.e. to infer patterns from the dataset without having a reference.

### Reinforcement learning
- Involves an agent that interacts with an environment, learning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success when the actions are carried out.
- In summary, the agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback.
- For example, to learn the best moves to win a game. The model comes up with a sequence of moves to play a game. At the end of each game, the game result (win or lose) can be used as a reward or punishment to identify that the current sequence of moves should be promoted or
discouraged.

## Important concepts in machine learning

### Underfitting
Underfitting is the situation in which the model is unable to solve learnt examples and generalise due to the lack of learning.

### Overfitting
Overfitting is the situation in which the model has high accuracy in solving learnt examples but unable to generalise due to over training.

### Bias
- Bias refers to the difference between the prediction of the model and the actual value.
- Low bias value means fewer assumptions are taken to build the target function. In this case, the model will closely match the training dataset.
- High bias value means more assumptions are taken to build the target function. In this case, the model will not match the training dataset closely. This occurs whenever we provide too little data for the model **(underfit)**

### Variance
- Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model towards noise. It basically refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. 
- Low variance means that the model is less sensitive to changes in the training data and can produce consistent estimates of the target function with different subsets of data from the same distribution. However, low variance can also indicate underfitting if the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- High variance means that the model is very sensitive to changes in the training data and can result in significant changes in the estimate of the target function when trained on different subsets of data from the same distribution. This is the case of **overfitting** when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen test data. It fits the training data too closely that it fails on the new training dataset. 

### Conclusion
- Hence, an ideal model must have low bias and low variance. This means that it must be able to generate an accurate and consistent answer. This can be acheived by acheiving good fit, that avoids underfitting or overfitting.
