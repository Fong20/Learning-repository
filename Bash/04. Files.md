# 04. Files

## Reading files
- We can **make use of the read command, while loop and redirection to read the contents of the text file**
- The contents of the text file can be read line by line or character by character

**Example: Reading the contents from the text file name sample_file.txt**

The text file which we would like to read from is placed at the end of the while loop. Redirection < is used to direct the content of the text file to the while loop. The read command is used to read a line from the text file and save it to the variable name CURRENT_LINE. The echo command in the loop is used to print out the content stored in the variable CURRENT_LINE.
