## Reading files
- We can **make use of the read command, while loop and redirection to read the contents of the text file**
- **The contents of the text file can be read line by line or character by character**

### Reading content of a text file line by line
**Example: Reading the contents from the text file name sample_file.txt line by line**

The **text file which we would like to read from is placed at the end of the while loop.** **Redirection < is used to direct the content of the text file to the while loop.** The read command is used to read a line from the text file and save it to the variable name CURRENT_LINE. The echo command in the loop is used to print out the content stored in the variable CURRENT_LINE.

### Reading content of a text file character by character
To read the content of a text file character by character, we need to use the -n argument of the read command and set the value to 1.

**Example: Reading the content from the text file name myText.txt character by character**
