# 05. Functions
- A Bash function is essentially a set of commands that can be called numerous times. 
- The purpose of a function is to help you make your bash scripts more readable and to avoid writing the same code repeatedly.
- Compared to most programming languages, Bash functions are somewhat limited.

## Declaring bash functions
There are generally two ways to declare a function:

  ### First method: function name followed by a parentheses
  This is the preferred and most used format as it is simpler to write

  ### Second method: function reserved word folowed by the function name

Important notes:
- The body of the function (commands) must be enclosed in the curly braces {}
- Defining a function doesn’t execute it. To invoke a bash function, simply use the function name. Commands between the curly braces are executed whenever the function is called in the shell script.
- The function definition must be placed before any calls to the function.
- When using single line “compacted” functions, a semicolon ; must follow the last command in the function.
- Always try to keep your function names descriptive.

## Variables
There are two types of vartlables
1. Global =  variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the script regardless of the scope.
2. Local =  the variables can only be used inside the function

**In Bash, all variables are defined as global variables by default , even if declared inside the function.** **Local variables can be declared within the function body with the local keyword and can be used only inside that function.** We can have local variables with the same name in different functions.

**Example of local vs global variable**

**Code**

The script starts by defining two global variables var1 and var2. Then there is an function that sets a local variable var1 and modifies the global variable var2.

**Results**

From the output, we can conclude that
- When a local variable is set inside the function body with the same name as an existing global variable, it will have precedence over the global variable.
- Global variables can be changed from within the function.

## Returning values
- Unlike functions in “real” programming languages, **Bash functions don’t return a value when called.** **When a bash function completes, its return value is the status of the last statement executed in the function**, **0 for success and non-zero decimal number in the 1 - 255 range for failure.**
- The return status can be specified by using the return keyword, and it is assigned to the variable $?. It terminates the function

There are two ways return a value from a function:

### First method: Assign the result of the function to a global variable
Declare and store the value in the global variable inside the function, invoke the function and print out the global variable

### Second method: return a value from a function is to send the value to stdout using echo or printf
Instead of simply executing the function which will print the message to stdout, we are assigning the function output to the func_result variable using the $() command substitution. The variable can later be used as needed.

## Passing arguments to bash functions
- To pass any number of arguments to the bash function simply put them right after the function’s name, separated by a space.
- It is a good practice to double-quote the arguments to avoid the misparsing of an argument with spaces in it.

**Special varaibles for functions**
1. $n = The passed parameters are $1, $2, $3 … $n, corresponding to the position of the parameter after the function’s name.
2. $0 = The $0 variable is reserved for the function’s name.
3. $ # = The $# variable shows the number of positional parameters/arguments passed to the function.
4. $* / $@ = The lists all positional parameters/arguments passed to the function in double quote.
6. "$*" = When double-quoted, "$*" expands to a single string separated by space (the first character of IFS) - "$1 $2 $n".
7. "$@" = When double-quoted, "$@" expands to separate strings - "$1" "$2" "$n".

**Note: When there is no double-quoted, $* and $@ have the same functionality.**
