# 05. Functions
- A Bash function is essentially a set of commands that can be called numerous times. 
- The purpose of a function is to help you make your bash scripts more readable and to avoid writing the same code repeatedly.
- Compared to most programming languages, Bash functions are somewhat limited.

## Declaring bash functions
There are generally two ways to declare a function:

### First method: function name followed by a parentheses
This is the preferred and most used format as it is simpler to write

### Second method: function reserved word folowed by the function name

Important notes:
- The body of the function (commands) must be enclosed in the curly braces {}
- Defining a function doesn’t execute it. To invoke a bash function, simply use the function name. Commands between the curly braces are executed whenever the function is called in the shell script.
- The function definition must be placed before any calls to the function.
- When using single line “compacted” functions, a semicolon ; must follow the last command in the function.
- Always try to keep your function names descriptive.

## Variables
There are two types of vartlables
1. Global =  variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the script regardless of the scope.
2. Local =  the variables can only be used inside the function

**In Bash, all variables are defined as global variables by default , even if declared inside the function.** **Local variables can be declared within the function body with the local keyword and can be used only inside that function.** We can have local variables with the same name in different functions.

**Example of local vs global variable**

**Code**

The script starts by defining two global variables var1 and var2. Then there is an function that sets a local variable var1 and modifies the global variable var2.

**Results**

From the output, we can conclude that
- When a local variable is set inside the function body with the same name as an existing global variable, it will have precedence over the global variable.
- Global variables can be changed from within the function.
