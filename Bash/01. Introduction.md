# 01. Introduction
Bash is a Linux command-line interpreter which allows the user to interpret commands to do various tasks.

## Variables
- In order to create and assign values to variables in shell script, we use the = symbol.
- It is recommended to not insert any whitespace before and after the = symbol as it might create errors

**Example:**

In the following code, we have created 2 variables, with the first named var and assigned the value 2104. The second variable created is named subject_code and assigned with a value CSC2104.

## Printing 
- In order to print out a message or value, we use the **echo** command
- We must insert $ before the variable to print out the value of the variable as the $ symbol is needed to extract the value stored inside the variable.

  **Example:**
  echo $var means printing the value associated with the variable named var whereas echo $subject_code means printing the value associated with the variable named subject_code.

## Read user input
**In shell scripting, we can take user input using the read command.**

## Arithmetic
- Performing arithmetic calculation using shell scripting is not as simple as compapred to other high-level languages.
- To handle decimal values, we need to use the bc (bash calculator) command

There are a few ways of performing arithmetic calculation using shell scripting:
- use of pipes
- use of let

  ### Performing arithmetic calculation using pipes
  By using pipes, it wlll allocate the values to the bc command and store inside the variable. The bc command is used to handle floating-point numbers.
  
  Example 1:

  ### Performing arithmetic calculation using let
  By using let, we no longer need to use pipes to perform arithmetic calculation
  
  Example: perform addition calculation of 2 and 4 and insert the answer to a variable named b.
  
  let b=2+4
  
  echo $b

  ### Scale command
  The scale command is used to specify the number of decimal places required for the output.

  Example:
  
  The following code echo "scale=2;22/7" | bc returns a 2 decimal place output

  ## Assignment and equality operators

  ## Relational operators
  Shell scripting does not support <, <=, >, >= unlike high-level languages. It has its own unique realtional operator.

  ## Logical operators
