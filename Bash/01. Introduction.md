# 01. Introduction
Bash is a Linux command-line interpreter which allows the user to interpret commands to do various tasks.

## Comments
- Comments are used to improve the readability of the code
- Not only that, it also helps other developers and system administrators who may need to maintain the script to understand your code and its purpose.

**Syntax for insert single-line comment**

**Syntax for inserting multi-line comment**

Bash only supports single line comment. Thus, we need to insert multiple single-line comment to write a multi-line comment

## Bash shebang
- **(#!) is called shebang and is used to tell the operating system which interpreter should be used to interpret the file.**
- If shebang is not specified and the user is running the Bash script using another Shell, the script will be parsed by the default interpreter of that Shell.
- Thus, we need to specify the executable path using shebang to ensure that the script will always be interpreted with Bash.

**Example of bash shebang:**
- #! is the shebang
- bin/sh is the interpreter

## Variables
- In order to create and assign values to variables in shell script, we use the = symbol.
- It is recommended to not insert any whitespace before and after the = symbol as it might create errors

**Example:**

In the following code, we have created 2 variables, with the first named var and assigned the value 2104. The second variable created is named subject_code and assigned with a value CSC2104.

## Printing 
- In order to print out a message or value, we use the **echo** command
- We must insert $ before the variable to print out the value of the variable as the $ symbol is needed to extract the value stored inside the variable.

  **Example:**
  echo $var means printing the value associated with the variable named var whereas echo $subject_code means printing the value associated with the variable named subject_code.

## Read user input
**In shell scripting, we can take user input using the read command.**

## Arithmetic
- Performing arithmetic calculation using shell scripting is not as simple as compapred to other high-level languages.
- To handle decimal values, we need to use the bc (bash calculator) command

There are a few ways of performing arithmetic calculation using shell scripting:
- use of pipes
- use of let

  ### Performing arithmetic calculation using pipes
  By using pipes, it wlll allocate the values to the bc command and store inside the variable. The bc command is used to handle floating-point numbers.
  
  Example 1:
  
  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/cf3e05a9-707b-41ca-b3b0-01a6542f48b6)
  
  ### Performing arithmetic calculation using let
  By using let, we no longer need to use pipes to perform arithmetic calculation
  
  Example: perform addition calculation of 2 and 4 and insert the answer to a variable named b.
  
  let b=2+4
  
  echo $b

  ### Arithmetic operators

  ### Scale command
  The scale command is used to specify the number of decimal places required for the output.

  Example:
  
  The following code echo "scale=2;22/7" | bc returns a 2 decimal place output

## Uppercase and lowercase
^ is used to convert the letter to uppercase , is used to convert the letter to lowercase
- ${variable_name^} = used to make the the first character uppercase (result: Hello)
- ${variable_name,} = used to make the first character lowercase (result: hELLO)
- ${variable_name,,} = used to make all the characters lowercase (result: hello)
- ${varaible_name^^} = used to make the all the characters uppercase (result: HELLO)

  
## Assignment and equality operators

## Relational operators
Shell scripting does not support <, <=, >, >= unlike high-level languages. It has its own unique realtional operator.

## Logical operators

## chmod
chmod is used to modify the access to the file. This ensures that only authorized users and processes can access files and directories.

The file permission can be configured for three different cases: 
- permission for the owner
- permission for the group (members which own the file)
- permission for others (everybody else)

There are two ways of changing permissions using chmod
- symbolic notation
- numeric notation

 ### Symbolic notation
 
 General syntax:
 
 Setting the file permission using symbolic notation starts with the type of user, operation flags followed by the permissions
 ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/19b74e24-f2aa-4ee8-b90d-a22e9e4b799a)
 
 The first set of flags (ugoa), defines which users classes the permissions to the file are changed.
 - u = The file owner.
 - g = The users who are members of the group.
 - o = All other users.
 - a = All users, identical to ugo.
 
 The second set of flags (-+=), the operation flags, defines whether the permissions are to be removed, added, or set:
 - - Removes the specified permissions.
 - + Adds specified permissions.
 - = Changes the current permissions to the specified permissions. If no permissions are specified after the = symbol, all permissions from the specified user class are removed.
 
 Permissions
 - r = read only
 - w = write only
 - x = executeable
 
 **Examples:**
 
 ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/571a488a-912f-4bfd-8377-033f08f18824)


 ### Numeric notation
 - When using the numeric mode, we can set the permissions for all three user classes (owner, group, and all others) at the same time by using three digits.
 - The first digit represents the permissions of the file’s owner, the second one the file’s group, and the last one all other users.

General syntax:

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/86216ffa-9aab-4a67-9e7b-bdd5e236de87)

Each write, read, and execute permissions have the following number value:
1. r (read) = 4
2. w (write) = 2
3. x (execute) = 1
4. no permissions = 0

The file’s permissions in numeric mode can be identified by simply calculating the total for all users classes. For example, to give read, write and execute permission to the file’s owner, read and execute permissions to the file’s group and only read permissions to all other users, the number is 754 which is calculated based on the following:

Owner: rwx=4+2+1=7

Group: r-x=4+0+1=5

Others: r-x=4+0+0=4
