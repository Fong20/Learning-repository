# 03. Loops
- Loops are used to repeat an operation multiple times instead of copy and pasting the same code multiple times
- The loop structure in shell scripting is almost similar to the loop structure found in many high-level languages.

There are two main types of loop:
- For loop
- While loop
  
## General structure of for loop vs while loop
- Condition / range to specify the condition to enter the loop
- There must be the do statement to tell the shell what to do when the condition is true
- done statement to indicate the end of the loop

## For loops
For loops allow us to execute statements specific number of times

  ### Looping with numbers
  There are three ways of looping with numbers:
  - list down all the values which you want to iterate
  - enclose the starting number and the ending number in a curly brace {}.
  - use the sequence command

    ### Listing down all the values to iterate

    ### Enclose the starting number and ending number with a curly brace

    ### Using sequence command
    - **The sequence command $seq() is used to print out a sequence of numbers.**
    - The first number in the sequence command is the start number, the middle number is to list down the step and the last number is the end number.

    The following code prints the output from 1 to 5 with a step of 2

    ### Looping with strings
    Besides looping with numbers, we can also loop with strings

  ## While loop
  While loops checks for a condition and loop until the condition remains true. A counter statement that increments the counter is needed to control the loop execution.

  Example
  The following code checks if the value of i is less than equal to 10 . If the value of i is less than equal to 0, it will enter the while loop and print out the value and increment the value of i by 1.
