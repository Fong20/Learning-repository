# 02. Conditional statement
- Conditional statements evaluates the condition before executing the task.
- Conditional statements are conducted using the if, if else, if else if else or nested conditional statement. The conditional statement in shell scripting is similar to high-level languages but has some minor differences.

The structure of conditional statements is as follows:
1. If statement (if...then...fi)
2. If else stement (if...then...else...fi)
3. If elif statement (if..elif..else..fi)
4. Nested conditional statement (if..then..else..if..then..fi..fi..)

## General syntax:
There are several things to take note when writing the condition of in the conditional statement.
- Firstly,** the condition to evaluate has to be enclosed within a square bracket [].** Not only that, **there must be whitespaces after and before the open square bracket and closed square bracket.**
- The **then statement is required to tell the script what to do when the condition is true**
- The **else statement is used to tell the script what to do when the condition is not true**
- The **fi statement is used to indicate the end of the conditional statement.**

## Shell switch case
- In shell scripting, **the case...esac statement functions simillar to the switch case of other high level languages.**
- The interpreter checks each case with the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a default condition will be used.

  ### General syntax
  - Each case is enclosed with a ) followed by the statement to be executed once the case is matched
  - ;; is inserted at the end of each case statement
  - *) is used to define a default condition. This condition will be executed if the value do not match with all other cases.

  Example:
  
  The following code will print out the result "New Zealand is famous for kiwi" since the value entered matches with the case kiwi.
