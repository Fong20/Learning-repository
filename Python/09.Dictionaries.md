# 09: Dictionaries
Similar to a list, Dictionaries are a form of collection as it is able to store multiple information in a single variable.

  ## Characteristics of dictionaries
  - Dictionaries are **ordered**, **mutable** and **do not allow duplicates** (Dictionaries cannot have two values with the same label)
  - The **elements inside the dictionary can be of any data type** (string, float, boolean, list etc)
  - There can be an empty dictionary.
  - Information inside the dictionary is represented in **curly braces {}** and in the form of **label : value**

    Eg:

  In this case, chuck is the label and 1 is the value associated with the label chuck.

  ## List vs Dictionaries
  - A **list is a linear collection of values that stay in order** while a **dictionary is a bag of values, each with its own label.**
  - List allows duplicate elements whereas dictionaries do not allow duplicate elements.
  - **Symbol.** Information is stored inside the List using the **square bracket symbol []** whereas the information of dictionary is stored inside using **curly braces symbol {}.**
  - **Indexing method.** List indexes their information based on their **position inside the list** whereas indexing of information in dictionaries are performed through the **label associated with the information.**

  ## Error in dictionaries (Dictionary Traceback)
  Python will throw an error when you try to reference a label which does not exist in the dictionary. In this case, we can use the in operator search for the specific label which will return a true/false output.

  ## Built-in functions can be used along with dictionaries
  Eg:

  - len() to find the number of elements inside the dictionary.
  - type() to identify the data type of the element inside the dictionary.
  - max() to identify the largest element in the dictionary.
  - min() to identify the smallest element in the dictionary.
  
  ## Converting elements into a dictionary explicitly
  By using dict() constructor, it is possible to make a dictionary.

  ## Get method for dictionaries
  The get method, get() basically allows us to check if a label is located inside a dictionary. If the **label is not found in the dictionary, it will return the default value.** Otherwise, it will return the value
  associated with the label.

  Eg:

  **x = counts.get(label, default_value)**
