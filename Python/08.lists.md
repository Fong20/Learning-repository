## Collections

What are collections?

- By default, a variable can only store a single information. (Eg: x = 10)
- A collection **allows us to insert many values into a single variable.**
- It is ideal as it allows us to carry many information around in one convenient package.
- There are many types of collections such as lists, dictionaries etc..

## Lists

- List is a **form of collection.**
- Elements inside a list are **stored inside a square bracket, []**
- Lists **can be empty.** (empty list)
- Lists can **store information of any data type** (string, integer, float, boolean etc)
- Lists are **mutable (information inside the list can be changed)**
- Lists **can be sliced.**
- A list can be inside another list. Eg: [1, [1], 2]

### Finding the number of elements inside the list
  We can **identify the number of elements inside the list** by using the `**len()` function**

### Adding new elements into a list
- Append method (`**.append**`) allows us to **add elements into a list.**
- The **new elements which are added into the list** are **always added at the end of the list.**

### Identifying if a specific element inside the list
- We can use **in operator to identify if a specific element is inside the list.**
- If the **specific element is found inside the list, it will return a true output. Otherwise, it will return a false output.**

### Sorting elements inside a list
We can **sort the elements inside the list by alphabetical order using the sort method (`.sort()`)**

### Range function
  By using the `range` function, it will **return a list of numbers from zero to the value one less than the parameter.**

***Eg: range(5) indicates [0,1,2,3,4]***

### Split method
- Split method .**`split()`** breaks a string into several parts and produces a list of strings.
- By default, the split method splits a string into several parts according to the blank space.

### List comprehension

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

**Basic syntax for list comprehension**

A basic list comprehension syntax consists of an expression, iterable and a condition.

- expression = Current item in the iteration/ outcome of new list which can be manipulated.
- iterable = elements to be iterated in a variable. The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.
- condition = The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.


  newlist = [**expression** for item in **iterable** if **condition** == True]

Eg:

Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, **containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.**

x is the expression, fruits is the iterable and  if "a" in x is the condition.
