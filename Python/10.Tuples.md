# Tuples

## General 
- It is also a form of collection (able to store multiple values in a single variable.)
- Uses parentheses ()
- Indexing of elements are similar to a list in which it indexes based on the postion of the element. Indexing starts at 0.
- It is immutable (values cannot be changed)
- It does not support methods which modifies the value as the values cannot be modified.

## Why use Tuples?

- It is more efficient in terms of memory use and performance compared to a list.
- It is mostly used as a temporary variable which do not need to be modified.

## Characteristics of Tuples
  
### Tuples are immutable

Once the values inside the tuple are declared, it cannot be changed.

### Tupples do not support methods which modifies the value.

- Methods such as **append, insert, pop, remove, reverse and sort cannot be used alongside with the Tuples** as the **values inside a Tuple cannot be modified.**
- Only **count and index** can be used alongisde Tupples.

### Tuples and Assignment

We can assign multiple values to multiple variables using a Tuple.

### Relationship between Tuples and Dictionaries

As mentioned before, we can use the **items method** in dictionaries and it will return a list of (key, value) tuples.

### Tuples are comparable

For comparison, Python will continue to compare each value until it finds the value which differs.

Eg:

(0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)

Although 2000000 is larger than 4 which technically should result to a false result. However, 1 is less than 3 which results to true result and Python will no longer continue to compare the following values.

### Sorting lists of Tuples

**Sorting based on keys**

- We can sort a list of tuples to get the sorted version of the dictionary.
- A list of tuples are obtained from the dictionary using the items() method and sorted based on the key in ascending order using the sorted() function.

**Sorting based on values**

- Instead of sorting based on the key, we can also sort based on the value. 
- This can be done by constructing a list of tuples using the items method. An empty list is then created and the iteration variable in the for loop is flipped. The values in the flipped iteration variable is then appended into the new empty list.

**.sorted(variable, reverse = True)** means **sort the values according to descending order**

### Creating a list of reversed tuples using List comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.


There are more steps and codes to perform to create a list of reversed tuples if list comprehension is not used which makes it more complex.

In this case, a list of reversed tuples are created using list comprehension and sorted in ascending order. Notice that everything is executed in a single line of code which makes it simpler and more efficient.
