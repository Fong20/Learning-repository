# Tuples

## General 
- It is also a form of collection (able to store multiple values in a single variable.)
- Uses parentheses ()
- Indexing of elements are similar to a list in which it indexes based on the postion of the element. Indexing starts at 0.
- It is immutable (values cannot be changed)
- It does not support methods which modifies the value as the values cannot be modified.

## Why use Tuples?

It is more efficient in terms of memory use and performance compared to a list.

## Characteristics of Tuples
  
### Tuples are immutable

Once the values inside the tuple are declared, it cannot be changed.

### Tupples do not support methods which modifies the value.

- Methods such as **append, insert, pop, remove, reverse and sort cannot be used alongside with the Tuples** as the **values inside a Tuple cannot be modified.**
- Only **count and index** can be used alongisde Tupples.

### Tuples and Assignment

We can assign multiple values to multiple variables using a Tuple.

### Relationship between Tuples and Dictionaries

As mentioned before, we can use the **items method** in dictionaries and it will return a list of (key, value) tuples.

### Tuples are comparable

For comparison, Python will continue to compare each value until it finds the value which differs.

Eg:

(0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)

Although 2000000 is larger than 4 which technically should result to a false result. However, 1 is less than 3 which results to true result and Python will no longer continue to compare the following values.
