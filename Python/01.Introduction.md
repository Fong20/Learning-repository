## Elements of Python

  1. **Reserved words**
  
      Special words which Python uses to execute a specific task. It cannot be used as a variable name/identifiers.
  
  2.  **Sequential step**
  
      Python executes the step 1 by 1 according to the line of code
  
  3.  **Conditional steps**
  
      Python only executes the indented code block when it meets a certain condition. This can be done by using decision statements such as if, if else, if elif else and nested if statement.
  
  4.  **Repeated steps**
  
      Python runs the indented code block multiple times if the condition is met. This is done through the use of loops such as while loop, for loop etc.

  ## How does Python code work?
  When the python code is executed, it is interpreted by the Python interpreter into machine code. The machine code can then be processed by the CPU to execute the right task.
