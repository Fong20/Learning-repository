## Conditional Structures

**Try except conditional statement**
- When an input entered by the user cannot be interpreted by Python, an error will occur and the subsequent codes after the error will no longer work. The whole program will stop running.
- Try except conditional statement is used as a backup to run another line of code just in case the input entered by the user will produce an error. This allows the program to continue running even though there is an error.
- Be careful when inputting multiple lines within the try function, it will execute the code inside the except function when the it detects the first error of code in the try function. The subsequent lines after the error code will not run.x = input("Enter a number")
