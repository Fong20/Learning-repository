# Loops and Iterations

## While loop

- While loops are **considered as indefinite loops** as **they keep executing the indented block of code until the condition statement becomes False.**

Has **2 main components** which allows it to operate smoothly

- **Condition statement**
- **Control statement**
- A while loop will execute the indented code block when the condition is true. The control statement controls how many times the the loop will be executed.
- A while loop which has **no control statement will produce an infinite loop.**

## Break statement (exiting the loop)

- The break statement signifies the end of the loop and executes the line of code after the loop.
- We can **use `break` to exit an infinite loop.**

```python
while True:
	line = input("enter input")
#Using break to exit infinite loop
	if line == "done":
		break
	print(line)
print("Done!")
```

## Continue statement (returns to the condition statement)

- The continue statement **ends the current loop and jumps back to the top of the loop** and **reruns the loop.**

```python
while True:
	line = input("enter input")
#If the first string of the word is #, execute continue statement which will return to the top of the loop.
	if line [0] == "#":
		continue
	if line == "done":
		break
	print(line)
print("Done!")
```

## For loops

- It is a **definite loop** which means they **execute a block of code in an exact number of times.**
- Unlike while loop which requires condition statement and control statement to control the iteration, for loop is much **simpler and its iteration can be done through 1 line of code by using the iteration variable.**
- When a for loop is set, the **iteration variable moves through all the values in the sequence.** The **code of block is executed once for each value in the sequence.**

```python
#Example 1
#i acts as the interation variable which changes value 5 times
#iteration variable moves through all values according to the sequence from left to right
'''answer will be
5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff'''
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
	print(i)
print("Blastoff")
```

**For loop using 2 variables**

Iteration variable is friends which contains 3 elements which means it will loop 3 times. The elements inside the iteration variable is assigned to another variable named friend.

**Looking for the largest number using for loop**

- **Iteration variable is the_num which contains 6 elements in it which means it will loop 6 times.**
- if statement is used to compare the value of the_num with the value of largest_so_far. When the value of the_num is more than the value of largest_so_far , the value of the_num will be assigned to largest_so_far.
- When the value of the_num is not more than the value of largest_so_far, it will not run the if statement and remain the current value assigned to it.

**Looking for the smallest number using for loop**

- Generally, finding the largest/smallest values by assigning a value to a variable to compare with the values in the iteration variable is not ideal.
- Eg: if we assign a negative value to variable “smallest” and we want to compare with the values in the iteration variable to find the smallest value, the result will still be the negative value as all the values in the iteration variable are positive numbers which are not less than the negative value in the variable “smallest”.
- To solve this issue, we assign **None** to the variable “smallest” and update the value of the variable with the first element of the iteration variable,  9 if “smallest” is None.

```python
#Assign None to variable smallest
smallest = None
for value in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]:

#As none is assigned to variable smallest, it fufills the if condition statement
	if smallest is None:
#assign the first element of iteration variable, 9 to smallest as smallest in None
		smallest = value 
```

- Subsequent loops will only compare the elements in the iteration variable with the element 9 inside the variable “smallest” to look for the smallest value. If an element in the iteration variable is smaller than 9, it will then update the variable “smallest” with the new value.

```python
#As the value of smallest is now 9, it is no longer none so it won't run the if statement anymore
#It will now run the elif statement if the value of iteration variable is less than smallest which is 9
elif value < smallest:

#update the value of variable smallest with the newest smallest value in the iteration variable
	smallest = value
```

- `**None**` keyword signifies an **empty value. It is not the same as 0, false or an empty string, it is a data type by its own.**

**is/is not operator**

- It **functions similar to equality operator (==) but it is stronger** in such a way **it compares not only if the values are the same but if the data type is the same.**

**Eg:**

0 **==** 0.0 will be **true as the values are the same.**

0 **is** 0.0 will be **false as the data type is different although the values are the same.**
