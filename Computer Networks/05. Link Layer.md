# 05. Link Layer

## Function of link layer
1. Addressing = Assigning and managing unique hardware address (MAC adddresses)
2. Framing = Dividing data into frames for transmission over a physical medium
3. Encapsulation = Encapsulates the datagram by Adding link layer header and trailer to create a frame
4. Medium access control = mechanism which determines how shared medium is accessed by multiple users without collision
5. Error detection and correction = detecting errors in the transmitted frame by using methods such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC), checksum etc 

## Frames
- A layer 2 packet
- It is created by encapsulating the datagram with link layer header and trailer

## Error detection and correction

### Sources of errors
- Errors are normally cause by signal attenuation and noise
- Signal attenuation = reduction in the signal strength / signal intensity as it travels through the medium. As the signal travels through a longer distance, there is higher tendency that the signal will lose its energy. It can also be due to transmission medium as each transmission medium have different signal attenuation
- Noise = random / unwanted interferrence from external sources which disrupts the signal

Once the receiver node detects an error, it can either:
- inform the sendor node to retranmit the frame
- correct the bit error

## Error detection and correction techniques
The are several error detection and correction techniques which are used to check for any errors within the received frame and notify the receiver node.

1. Parity check
2. Checksumming
3. Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
   
**Error detection and correction bits (EDC)**
- Additional bits (redundant bits) which are added to the original data for error detection means
- Error detection is not 100% reliable as it may miss some errors. However, it is utilized to reduce the amount of errors and ensure that it does not exceed the receiver's sensitivity.

### Parity check
Important terms in parity check:
1. d = data in bits
2. parity = 1 bit
   
There are two types of parity check:
1. Single bit parity
2. Two-dimensional parity

**Single bit parity**
- Single bit parity only detects single bit error
- Single bit parity can be further divided into two types which are even parity and odd parity. We can choose to implement either odd parity or even parity for error detection, there is no fixed use cases for each parity.

1. **Even parity**
- In even parity, the total number of 1 after adding parity bit (d + 1) is even

2. **Odd parity**
- In odd parity, the total number of 1 after adding parity bit (d + 1) is odd

**Example:**

There are 9 1's in the data bit. As a result, we do not need to add 1 in the parity bit as it will make it an even parity (10 bits)

**Two-dimensional parity**
- In two-dimensional parity, the data is divided into rows and columns and the parity will be computed for each row and column
- It detects and corrects single bit error

Disadvantages of parity check
- It cannot detect even number of bit error
- It only detects for errors but do not correct them
