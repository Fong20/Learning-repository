# 05. Link Layer

## Function of link layer
1. Addressing = Assigning and managing unique hardware address (MAC adddresses)
2. Framing = Dividing data into frames for transmission over a physical medium
3. Encapsulation = Encapsulates the datagram by Adding link layer header and trailer to create a frame
4. Medium access control = mechanism which determines how shared medium is accessed by multiple users to avoid collision
5. Error detection and correction = detecting errors in the transmitted frame by using methods such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC), checksum etc 

## Frames
- A layer 2 packet
- It is created by encapsulating the datagram with link layer header and trailer

## Error detection and correction

### Sources of errors
- Errors are normally cause by signal attenuation and noise
- Signal attenuation = reduction in the signal strength / signal intensity as it travels through the medium. As the signal travels through a longer distance, there is higher tendency that the signal will lose its energy. It can also be due to transmission medium as each transmission medium have different signal attenuation
- Noise = random / unwanted interferrence from external sources which disrupts the signal

### Error detection and correction techniques
- The key concept to error detection is by adding additional bits (parity bits in parity check / redundant bits in CRC) which to the original data for error detection means
- Error detection is not 100% reliable as it may miss some errors. However, it is utilized to reduce the amount of errors and ensure that it does not exceed the receiver's sensitivity.
- There are several error detection and correction techniques which are used to check for any errors within the received frame and notify the receiver node.

1. Parity check
2. Checksumming
3. Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

**Once the receiver node detects an error, it can either:**
- inform the sendor node to retranmit the frame
- correct the bit error

**Example of error detection process**

### Parity check
Parity check is a simple technique which is used to detect errors in a frame

**Important terms in parity check:**
1. d = data in bits
2. parity = 1 bit
   
**There are two types of parity check:**
1. Single bit parity
2. Two-dimensional parity

**Single bit parity**
- Single bit parity only detects single bit error
- Single bit parity can be further divided into two types which are even parity and odd parity. We can choose to implement either odd parity or even parity for error detection, there is no fixed use cases for each parity.

1. **Even parity**
- In even parity, the total number of 1 after adding parity bit (d + 1) is even

2. **Odd parity**
- In odd parity, the total number of 1 after adding parity bit (d + 1) is odd

**Example:**

There are 9 1's in the data bit. As a result, we do not need to add 1 in the parity bit as it will make it an even parity (10 bits)

**Two-dimensional parity**
- In two-dimensional parity, the data is divided into rows (i) and columns (j) and the parity will be added for each dimension (row and column)
- It detects and corrects single bit error

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d4ae8ea-88ab-43fa-97d1-5f2aa1b0c6c2)

**Example:**
- In this case, the sender is using even parity for error detection. Thus, each row and column must have an even number of 1's after adding the parity bit. The data is then sent to the receiver.
- As the data is being received by the receiver, it knows that it is using even parity is used for error detection and checks if the bits of each column and row is even.
- It turns out there is a single bit error on the row 2 and column 2 as the number of 1's is not even as according to the sender which uses even parity. As a result, the receiver knows that there is an error in the received frame.

**Disadvantages of parity check**
- It only detects for errors but do not correct them
- It cannot detect even number of bit error. When there are an even number of bits which are different from the sender's bits, it cannot detect that it has an error.

### Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

**Important terms in CRC:**
1. D = data bits to be sent, d bits
2. R = redundancy bits, r bits
3. G = generator polynomial, it is basically the dividor which is used to find the remainder

**CRC technique to find the redundancy bits at the sender side**
1. Add 0's to the data to be sent, D. The amount of 0's to be added to the data is determined by subtracting the number of bits of generator polynomial, G by 1.
2. Divide the data, D by the generator polynomial, G and perform binary XOR operation
3. The remainder will be the redundancy bits, R. The number of redundancy bits must be equivalent to the number of 0's added to the original data. Eg: If 3 bits are added to the original bits, the redundancy bits must also be 3 bits
4. The redundancy bits, R are added to the original data bits, D, (D + R)

The sender will send these bits (original data bits + redundancy bits) to the receiver and the receiver will check if the data is received correctly by dividing the received data again with the generator polynomial and if the remainder is 0, the data has no errors.

## Multiple access links and protocols
There are essentially two types of link

1. Point to point
- In point to point connection, as sender transmits a signal to a receiver
- Eg: Transmission of signal between the ethernet switch and host

2. Broadcast
- In broadcast connection, multiple senders tranmit signals in a shared medium and a single transmission can be received by multiple receivers
- However, there is risk that collision will occur when more than one node transmit signal at the same time.
- Eg: Shared link between multiple hosts in a network (cabled ethernet), shared radio frequency network

### Medium access control (MAC) protocol
Media access control is used to coordinate the transmission of signal by nodes to prevent collision in a broadcast connection.

There are three types of medium access control protocols:
1. Channel partitioning protocol
2. Random access protocol
3. Taking-turn protocol

### Channel partitioning protocol
- Channel partitioning protocol divides the channel into smaller parts which could be through time slot in TDM or frequency in FDM and allocates it to the node
- There are two types of protocols which fall under channel partitioning protocol which are time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM)

**Time division multiplexing (TDM)**
- In TDM, Time is divided into Time Frame
- Frame is divided into Time Slot and each time slot is assigned to one of the N nodes for transmission
- Unused slot is wasted
- The nodes access the time slot in round

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0b2feb9-b330-449b-8c32-4994fe7bc83b)

**Advantages**
- Reduced collision
- Fair distribution of time to multiple nodes for signal transmission (Let channel bandwidth = R
bps, number of time slots = N, Each node get R/N bps)

**Disadvantages**
- Unused slot is wasted, and cannot be used by other nodes
- Node must wait for its allocated time slot to transmit
- All nodes must be time synchronized

**Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)**
- In FDM, the Channel bandwidth is R bps is divided into different bands and each band is assigned to one of the N
nodes for transmission. Thus, each band has a bandwidth of R/N bps
- Unused band is wasted

**Advantages**
- Reduced collision
- Fair distribution of time to multiple nodes for signal transmission (Let channel bandwidth = R
bps, number of time slots = N, Each node get R/N bps)

**Disadvantages**
- Unused band is wasted, and cannot be used by other nodes
- Node cannot transmit more than the allocated band which has a bandwidth of R/N bps

### Random access protocol
- In random access protocols, multiple nodes share the same communication medium without any pre-assigned time slots or frequency bands as found in channel partitioning protocols.
- Basically, data is transmitted on the channel randomly without any coordination between the nodes. Hence, there is collision when two or more nodes transmit signal on the same medium at the same time.
- Detect collision and recover from collision
- There are three types of protocols which fall under random access protocol which are slotted ALOHA, Carrier sense multiple Access (CSMA), and Carrier sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
  
**Slotted ALOHA**
- Frame is divided into Time Slots but **each time slot is not assigned to one of the N nodes for transmission**. **Each of the nodes in the network will access the time slots randomly** to transmit data and the success of data transmision depends if there are other transmissions within the same time slot. If there are other transmissions being made within the same time slot, collision will occur and the transmission will fail.
- If collision, retransmit again at some other time according to the retransmission probability, p
- There might not be any users which would transmit data at any point of time, hence, the time slot is unused and wasted.

**Example:**

**Important terms**
1. C = collision
2. E - empty time slot
3. S = successful transmision

In the following example, there are 3 nodes which are transmitting data along each time slots. If there are more than 1 tranmission on a time slot, it will cause collision.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73e32056-f82f-48eb-8a9c-7b9b8cda5d25)


**Advantages**
- Node need NOT wait for its allocated time slot to transmit, it Can transmit at full bandwidth of R bps
- Reduce collision. If there is collision, retransmit again with probability p. The probability reduces as the number of retransmission increases
- Fair. If collision, retransmit again with a fair probability p

**Disadvantages**
- Unused slot is wasted
- All nodes must be time synchronized to ensure successful transmission

**Calculating the efficiency of slotted ALOHA protocol**

The efficiency of slotted ALOHA protocol can be determined through the Long run percentage of time slots with successful transmissions

**Important terms**
1.N = Number of nodes
2. p = Probability that a node transmit in a time slot
3. 1-p = Probability that a node do NOT transmit in a time slot

Probability that N-1 nodes do NOT transmit in a time slot, (1-p)^N-1 where N-1 represents only 1 node is successful in transmitting data in a single time frame while others fail

Probability of a node’s successful transmission, p(1-p)^N-1

Efficiency = Probability of N nodes’ successful transmission = Np(1-p)^N-1

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**
- The difference of CSMA with slotted ALOHA is that **CSMA senses the condition of the channel before transmission**
- If channel is sensed idle, transmit the frame
- If channel is sensed busy, defer the transmission
- However, collision can still occur as the node cannot sense Propagation delay cause two nodes
unable to hear each other immediately. Thus, a Longer propagation delay causes more collision
- Eg: At t = 0 , a node transmis signal on the channel. At t = 1 , the signal has not arrive at a second node yet due to propagation delay. Hence, The second node has a false sense that the channel is idle and transmits data on the same channel, causing collision.

**Disadvantage**

No collision detection. Continue transmission even collision occur

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)**
- The difference of CSMA/CD with CSMA is that **CSMA senses the condition of the channel before transmission and during transmission**
- If channel is sensed idle, transmit the frame
- If channel is sensed busy, defer the transmission
- If collision is detected during transmission, the node will stop the transmission immediately and retransmit again after a random delay
- CSMA/CD is used in Ethernet networks

**Retransmission of data in CSMA/CD**
- The random delay of retransmission is determined by using binary exponential backoff process
- Binary exponential backoff provides the node to dynamically adjust their retransmission probability

**Important terms**
1. nth collision = number of collisions. **Note: The maximum number of collision is 10**
2. K = number of time slots which need to be wait before retransmission

**Retransmission using Binary exponential backoff process**
1. Determine the nth collision
2. Calculate the number of time slots which need to be wait before retransmission, R = 2^n - 1
3. Choose either 1 time slots from 0 to the calculated number of time slots which need to be wait before retransmission, R which will determine the which time slot to retransmit the data.

### Taking-turn protocol
- Nodes take turn to transmit signal
- There are two types of protocols which fall under taking-turn protocol which are polling protocol and token-passing protocol

**Polling protocol**
- In polling protocol, Polling is controlled by the master node. The master node polls the slave nodes in a round-robin manner (take turns)
- Nodes which are polled are known as slaves
- Slave node transmit packet when polled

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c0dcaf-e272-41c1-87a2-6c65b21ee1e9)

**Disadvantages**
- Polling overhead. Additional bits are required to be added to the original data for the protocol to work.
- Latency. All slave nodes are polled which includes the slave nodes which do not transmit any data. Thus, it causes additional delay for other slave nodes to transmit data. 
- Single point of failure (As the master is in charge of polling slave nodes for transmission, a master failure will cause the whole system to fail)

**Token-passing protocol**
- In token-passing protocol, the token is required for transmission.
- The token is then passed from one node to the another sequentially

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e217e4-767d-4995-b405-d702cd39f195)

**Disadvantages**
- Token overhead. Additional bits are required to be added to the original data for the protocol to work
- Latency. Tokens are passed to one node to another for transmission which includes nodes which do not tranmit any data. Thus, the resources are wasted and the other nodes which need to transmit data must wait for the token to be transferred, which increases latency. 
- Single point of failure which could either be caused by lost token, Node forgot to release token, failure of the Node that hold the tokens, and failure of the link

## Link layer addressing
As mentioned, one of the function of link layer is to assign and manage MAC adddresses which are essentially unique hardware address

### MAC address
- MAC address is a 12 hexadecimals (48 bits) unique physical address which acts as a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies a device within a network. It is a layer 2 address
- It is known as a physical address as it does not change according to the network
- The first 24 bits are known as the Organizationally unique identifer (OUI) which is uniquely assigned by the device's manufacturer and the remaining 24 bits are the device's network interface card which is unique to each device
- Each interface has unique MAC address which is used to forward frames

### Link layer switch
- Link layer switch is a layer 2 switch which is used to transmit frames to devices within the same network
- It uses CSMA/CD

**Store and Forward frame**
- One of the swtiching methods used is store and forward method
- In store and forward method, it will check the received frame and compute Cyclic Redundency Check (CRC) for any errors. If the CRC has error, the ethernet frame will be dropped. If the CRC is valid, it will then look into the destination MAC address and its associated port and send the frame to the destination through the correct port.
- Frames can be forwarded to one or more outgoing links without collisions as the frame is transmitted through the correct destinmation MAC address and its assiociated port.

Eg: A to A’ and B to B’ can transmit simultaneously, without collisions

- However, Store and Forward switching can cause delay in switching since Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is calculated for each Ethernet frame.
 
**Advantages of link layer switch**
1. Transparent. The Host is not aware of switches
2. Self learning (or plug and play), the switches do not need to be manually configured to transmit frames to other nodes within the network 

**Self-learning process of link layer switches**

Switch uses the MAC address table to make switching decisions

1. When The switch receives a frame, it will check the source MAC address.
2. The switch then records the source MAC address and the switch port which is mapped to the source MAC address into the MAC address table.
3. It then checks the destination MAC address of the frame if it is in the MAC address table. If it is not inside the MAC address table, the switch broadcasts the frame with the destination MAC address to all ports except for the port which received the frame.
4. The device will reply to the broadcasted frame with a unicast frame when it has the destiantion MAC address.
5. The switch maps the destionation MAC address to the port which the message arrives and records it into the MAC address table. The destination MAC address and its associated port can now be found in the MAC address table.
6. The switch can now forward the frame to the destination as it already knows the destination MAC address and its associated port number. It is able to forward frames between source and destination devices without flooding as the switch has the entries in the address table that identify the associated ports.

### Comparison of switches and routers
1. Both switches and routers use store and forward technique in transmitting packets
2. Router is a layer 3 device (network layer). It examines the network layer header. while link layer switch is a layer 2 device. It examines the link-layer header
3. Both the router and switch have forwarding tables. It is known as routing table for routers and MAC address table for switches. Routers compute the table using routing algorithm and IP address to make routing decisions while switches compute the forwarding table by using self-learning method and MAC address.
