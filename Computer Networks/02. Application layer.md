# 02. Application layer
- Function: Ensures an application can effectively communicate with another application which runs on different computer systems and networks
- The applications run on the host
- Application layer is not related to the network core as the network core do nut run user applications. It only carries network data, not the user's data.

**Example of protocols which run on application layer**
1. HTTPS/ HTTP
2. DNS
3. DHCP
4. SMTP
5. IMAP
6. POP3
7. FTP

## Application architecture
There are two types of application architecture
1. Client-server 
2. Peer to peer

### Client-server
- In a client-server arechitecture, there exists a dedicated client and a dedicated server and each of them perform a specific role.
- Client =  The client's main function is to request services from the server. A client will have a dynamic IP address, the IP address may change time to time. It also does not communicate directly with each other.
- Server = The server's main function is to provide services which are requested from the client. A server will always have a dedicated IP address (fixed IP address). It is also known as an always on host.

**Advantages**
- Client-server provides a guaranteed service as the server is always functioning and online (always-on host).

**Disadvantages**
- More complex and expensive to implement since a dedicated server needs to be setup. Moreover, as the number of people requesting the service increases, there is the need to expand the number of servers which would drive up the cost.

### File distribution time of Client-Server architecture
**Important formula terms:**
1. N = number of copies of file
2. F = size of the file
3. Us = Upload speed of server
4. dmin = minimum client download rate (we always choose the lowest client rate to ensure that the client with the lowest download rate would be able to receive the downloaded content as well)
5. Dcs = Distribution time to distribute file (size F) to N clients using client-server

NF/Us = time taken for the server to upload N copies of file

F/dmin = Minimum time taken for the client to download the file

By using max, the larger value among both values calculated using the formula will determine if the client / server is increasing the distribution time.

### Peer to peer
- In peer to peer architecture, there is no decicated client and server. Each of the nodes may act as both a client which request services or as a server which provide services.
- Example: file sharing (BitTorrent), internet telephony(Skype)

**Advantages**
- More cost efficient as there is no need for the implementation of expensive servers
- Self-scalability. Peer to peer network architecture can be easily upgraded and increased to accomodate more users

### File distribution time of Peer to peer
utotal = Us + u1 + u2 + ... uN (sum of all upload rate of all participating clients)

F/Us = time taken for the server to upload a file

F/dmin = Minimum time taken for the client to download the file

NF/utotal = Minimum client download rate with peer upload

## Process communication

**Process**
- A process is defined as a program which is running on a host.
- Processes in different hosts communicate with each other by exchanging messages.
- A process is uniquely identified by its port number

**Sockets (Application Programming Interface, API)**
- As mentioned above, processes communicate with one another by exchanging messages. The messages are sent / received through sockets.
- Sockets allow the process to communicate with the bottom layers (transport, network, link, and physical) which are controlled by the OS
- The socket is located in between the application and transport layer

## Round-trip time (RTT)
Refers to the time taken for a packet to travel from the client to the server and then back to the client

### Formula:

RTT = 2 X propagation time

## Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
- HTTP is an application layer protocol which is used for web services (request and receive webpages)
- HTTP is stateless (the server does not maintain / remember the information about past client requests)
- HTTP uses TCP

**Types of HTTP messages**
1. HTTP request
2. HTTP response

In terms of client-server architecture, the client requests for the webpage through the web browser. The web server then replies to the request by providing the webpage objects. Lastly, the webpage objects are received and displayed by the client's web browser.

**How does HTTP work?**
- Before HTTP protocol is used to obtain webpage services, TCP connection is established between the client and the server through TCP 3 way handshake using port 80.
- After TCP connection is established between the client and server,  HTTP messages are exchanged between the client and server.
- Once the HTTP messages are exchanged finished, the TCP connection is closed

**Types of HTTP connections:**
1. Non-persistent HTTP connection
2. Persistent HTTP connection

### Non-persistent HTTP connection
- In non-persistent HTTP connection, **a single TCP connection can only send at most one object over**. The connection is then closed
- If we want to download multiple objects, we need to establish multiple connections.
- This can be solved by setting up multiple TCP connections parallely.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a086012b-55e1-458b-984e-ae3c75afe5e7)

**Disadvantages**
- Since a single TCP connection can only send at most one object. Multiple connections are required to download multiple objects which increases delay.

### Persistent HTTP connection
- In persistent HTTP connection, multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection. The connection is then closed. Thus, a single TCP connection is only required to download multiple objects.
- The server leaves the connection open after the HTTP response is sent and the connection will only be closed when it is not used for a specific certain time.

**Pipelined persistent HTTP connection**
- Refers to the ability of the client to request multiple different requests and receive the HTTP responses simultaneously.
- As a result, the amount of time required for the user to obtained the required information is reduced since there is less delay. Only as a little as a single RTT is required to obtain all the required information.

### HTTP response time
HTTP response time is defined as the combination of 2RTT and the file transmission time

**Formula:**

HTTP response time = 2RTT + File transmission time

- First RTT refers to establishment of TCP connection
- Second RTT refers to the exchange of HTTP messages (HTTP request and response)

2 RTT = total of 4 connections established

The file transmission time highly depends on the network's bandwidth and the size of the file

## Web caching
- Web caching refers to the process of saving / storing frequently requested object in a local proxy server.
- A Proxy server is a local server which stores frequently used content

### Web caching process
1. The client (browser) sends the HTTP request to the proxy server to obtain the objects.
2. If the object is available in the proxy server, the server returns the objects to the client through HTTP response
3. If the object is unavailable in the proxy server, the proxy server requests the object from the origin server

 ### Advantages of web caching
- It reduces response time (smaller round trip time) and resources as the object can now be obtained from the local proxy server instead of its origin server, resulting in an effective content delivery
- Reduced traffic

## Domain Name System (DNS)
- The main function of DNS is to translate a domain name into its IP address.
- DNS is a distributed system. It works by using a hierachy of distributed DNS servers 

**Why is DNS not run through a centralized server?**
- Single point of failure (Failure on the central server disrupts the whole DNS process)
- High traffic volume (All DNS queries will be sent to a single central server
- High delay (DNS server could be located far away from the DNS client)
- High maintenance (The DNS server needs to be updated with a large record of hostnames)

**Types of DNS servers**
1. Local DNS server (Recursive server) = takes DNS queries from the client and either provides the answer to the query if it has it cached or accesses the next-level server if it doesn't. 
2. Root server = (identifies the top level domain of the website which is the last part of the website and forwards it to the specific top level domain server. Eg: .com, .org, .edu)
3. Top-Level Domain server = Directs the query to the authoratative server
4. Authoritative (Providing IP address of the website)

**How DNS works:**
1. The client queries the local DNS server for the required IP address 
2. If the required IP address is found, the local DNS server will send the IP address back to the client. Otherwise, it will query the root DNS server to find the top level domain server (TLD)
3. The top level domain server will then dirtect the query to the authoritative server in which it will provide the IP address for the domain name.
4. Once the IP address is resolved, it will be sent back to the local DNS server where it will store a record of the IP address associated with the domain name for faster access in the future.

**Two types of query to find the authoritative DNS server**
1. Iterated query 
2. Recursive query 

### Iterated query
Iterative DNS queries take place between the recursive resolver, which is a local DNS server, and the nonlocal name servers, like the root, TLD and authoritative name servers. Iterative queries do not demand a name resolution; the name servers may instead respond with a referral. The root server refers the recursive server to the TLD, which refers it to an authoritative server. The authoritative server provides the domain name to the recursive server if it has it. Iterative queries resolve in either an answer or a referral.

### Recursive query
- In recursive query, name resolution is performed at the recursive server. The recursive server must provide the client with the required IP address.
- As a result, it puts heavy load at all the servers

### DNS caching
- DNS caching functions similar to web caching where frequently stored data is stored in a server. In this case, the frequently used DNS resolutions (mapping of hostname and IP addresses) are stored in a local DNS server
- It has a cache entry timeout where the stored DNS resolutions will be removed after it is not utilized for a specific amount of time

**Advantages of DNS caching**
- Reduce number of DNS message
- Reduced delay as it reduces the amount of visits to the root servers
