# 01. Computer  Networks and the Internet

## 1.1 Basic terms
There are several important basic terms in computer networks

### Throughput and loss
Throughput =

Loss = Packets which are not received. Each device has its own loss threshold. It must be within the specified threshold or the device can no longer accept information

### Internet service provider
Provides internet services 

Types of ISP
- Local
- Global

### Hosts
Hosts are known as devices which participate in a connection

### Link
Link refers to the connection between devices

Types of link (connection)
- wired (twisted pair copper cable, fiber optic cable)
- wireless (wifi, bluetooth, rfid, infrared, nfc etc)

bandwidth = maximum amount of data which can transmitted over a network in a given time

Fiber optic uses light as the medium of transmission. Light has the biggest spectrum. As a result, the highest bandwidth which results to higher data rate and throughput

## Types of network
- Hetrogineous network = network which consists of mulitiple types of devices
- Homogenous network = network which only consists of a specific type of device

### Packet
- Host divide data into segments , add header to each segment to generate a packet
- Destination reassemble packets into data

### Switch
The main function of switch is to recive and forward packets towards the required destination

Types of switches
- router (layer 3 switch): used in core networks
- link layer switch (layer 2 switch): used in access networks

### Route/path
- End to end connection = path/connection from the sender to the receiver
- Comprised of links and switches

There are no best path to transmit a packet as there are various paths to transmit a packet. It is up to the network engineer to determine the best path to transmit the packet based on the required application.

Various factors which determine the path
- bandwidth
- length of path
- security
- stability
- availability (determine if the link is available)

## Protocols
Are rules which are followed for in network communication

## 1.2 Access networks
- Connects hosts to the edge router
- Edge router = the first router in the global or regional ISP. The edge router connects the host to the ISP.
- Access network consists of the home network, mobile network and institutional network

## 1.3 Core network
Core network consists of the ISP

**Types of core network**
1. Packet switching (Eg: Internet)
2. Circuit switching (Eg: LAN line, telephone lines)

### Packet switching vs Circuit switching
Generally, packet switching is more efficient than circuit switching. This is due to the factor of requirement of end to end resource reservation.

In circuit switching, the resource must be reserved for the entire duration of the communication session. If there is no communication session conducted, the resource which is allocated is wasted.

Meanwhile, packet switching uses resources (e.g., bandwidth) along a path from source host to destination host in an on demand manner.

### Packet switching

**Store and forward transmission**

The main concept of the packet switching is the store and forward transmission. Basically, All bits of a packet must be received before it can be transmitted

Why do we need to store the bits in a packet before transmitting it?
- Identification of bits from various different sources.

**Network performance**
There are two aspects in network performance:
1. Queuing delay =  Amount of time which the packets are waiting in queing before it is transmitted from the router
2. Packet loss = Packets which are lost as a result as the router can no longer accept and process the packets

An ideal network is where a router which has less queuing delay and packet loss. Typically, the router hardware affects the network performance

**Routing protocol**

Used by each router to determine the shortest path to each destination and use the shortest path to configure its forwarding table.
Forwarding table:
