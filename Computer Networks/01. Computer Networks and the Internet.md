# 01. Computer  Networks and the Internet

## 1.1 Basic terms
There are several important basic terms in computer networks

### Throughput and loss
Throughput = rate at which bits are transferred between source host and destination host

Types of throughput
1. Instantaneous throughput = rate at a particular point of time
2. Average throughput = rate over a long period of time

Loss = Packets which are not received. Each device has its own loss threshold. It must be within the specified threshold or the device can no longer accept information

### Internet service provider
Provides internet services 

Types of ISP
- Local
- Global

### Hosts
Hosts are known as devices which participate in a connection

**Types of host**
- clients (Eg: computers, smartphones etc)
- server / data centers (devices which provide services such as email services or webpage services)

### Link
Link refers to the connection between devices for communication. 

bandwidth = maximum amount of data which can transmitted over a network in a given time. It is measuared in bits per second (bps)

**Types of link (connection)**
There are various types of links and each of them contain different bandwidth
- wired (twisted pair copper cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable)
- wireless (wifi, bluetooth, rfid, infrared, nfc etc)

Fiber optic uses light as the medium of transmission and it has the largest spectrum. As a result, it contains the highest bandwidth which results to higher data rate and throughput.

### Types of network
- Local area network (LAN)
- Wide area network (WAN)
- Metropolitan area network (MAN)
- Hetrogineous network = network which consists of mulitiple types of devices
- Homogenous network = network which only consists of a specific type of device

### Packet
- Host divides data into segments , and adds header to each segment to generate a packet
- When the packet reachaes its destination, the packets are reassembled into data

### Switch
The main function of switch is to receive and forward packets towards the required destination

**Types of switches**
- link layer switch (layer 2 switch): Layer 2 switches are used to connect devices in the same LAN. It is used in access networks
- router (layer 3 switch): Routers are used to connect multiple LANs together. It is used in core networks

### Route/path
- A route is defined as an end to end connection from the sender to the receiver. It comprises of links and switches

There are no best path to transmit a packet as there are various paths to transmit a packet. It is up to the network engineer to determine the best path to transmit the packet based on the required application.

Various factors which determine the path
- bandwidth
- length of path
- security
- stability
- availability (determine if the link is available)

## Protocols
Protocols are standardized rules which are followed in network communication.

## 1.2 Access networks
- An access network is a type of network which physically connects an end system to the edge router
- Edge router = A specialized router that is located at the boundary of a network which allows devices in an internal network to connect to devices which are located in the external network. It essentially connects hosts to the respective ISP. The edge router is also the first router in the global or regional ISP.
- Access networks may utilize different types of link such as wired, wireless or a combination of both (hybrid).
- Example of access networks: Ethernet, wifi, 3G/4G/5G, Digital subscriber line (DSL) etc..

## 1.3 Core network
Core network consists of the ISP

**Types of core network**
1. Packet switching (Eg: Internet)
2. Circuit switching (Eg: LAN line, telephone lines)

## Types of interference
1. co-channel = multiple users use the same frequency
2. adjacent-channel = a network which is using a frequency of 4khz and a network is using a frequency of 5khz. Because the frequencies are adjacent and very near to each other

## Circuit switching
There are two types of circuit switching:
- Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)
- Time-division multiplexing (TDM)

Multiplexing = sending data to multiple users at the same time

### Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)
- In FDM, A dedicated frequency band is assigned to each connection. The width of the frequency band indicates the bandwidth. Frequency is divided between different users
- FDM is the solution to co-channel interference
- In order to implement FDM, we must make sure the range of frequencies of each link are wide enough to avoid adjacent-channel interference.

### Time-division multiplexing
- In TDM, Frequency remains the same, but the time in which it is used differs
- The downside of TDM is it's complex implementation since it is hard to perform time synchronization.

## Packet switching

**Store and forward transmission**

In packet switching, the packets need to wait at queue due to the store and forward transmission. Basically, all bits of a packet must be received before it can be transmitted.

Why do we need to store the bits in a packet before transmitting it?
- Identification of bits from various different sources.

### Delay in packet switching networks
There are 4 types of delay in packet switching networks:
1. Proessing delay (The amount of time taken by the hardware to process a packet. It depends on the processing power of the hardware)
2. Queuing delay (The amount of time in which the packet is waiting to be transmitted)
3. Transmission delay (the amount of time taken for the sender to push all the bits of a packet into the link)
4. Propagation delay (The amount of time taken for the link to transfer all bits to the destination)

Formula of
L = size of the packet
R = transfer rate of the link

d = distance between the transmitter and the receiver
s = speed of the link

Note: The most unpredictable delay among all 4 types of delay is queuing delay since it highly depends on the network traffic.

### Traffic intensity
- Minimum traffic intensity = 
- Maximum traffic intensity = 1
- Traffic intensity > 0.7 = congestion which will affect performance

**Formula:**

Traffic intensity = transmission delay * packet arrival rate

When traffic intensity increases, the queuing delay increases

### Packet switching vs Circuit switching
Generally, packet switching is more efficient than circuit switching. This is due to the factor of requirement of end to end resource reservation.

**In circuit switching, the resource must be reserved (dedicated end-to-end connection or circuit) from the source host to the destination host for the entire duration of the communication session.** If there are no communication utilizing the resource, the resource which is allocated is wasted.

Meanwhile, **packet switching uses resources (e.g., bandwidth) along a path from source host to destination host in an on demand manner.**

### Bottleneck link
Is defined as the link of an end-to-end path that constraints the throughput

**Network performance**
There are two aspects which affects network performance:
1. Queuing delay =  Amount of time which the packets are waiting in queue before it is being transmitted.
2. Packet loss = Packets which are dropped as the queue is full. This will disrupt the user experience

Basically, if the amount of packets received is more than the amount of packets transmitted, congestion will occur at the router as the queue becomes full. This resualts to the increase in queuing delay and packet loss.

An ideal network is where a router which has minimal queuing delay and packet loss. Delay cannot be eliminated since there will always be limited memory and limited processing power. Therefore, a better hardware system will reduce the amount of delay, increasing peformance.

**Routing protocol**

**The routing protocol is used by each router to determine the shortest path to each destination** and **use the shortest path to configure its forwarding table.**

**Forwarding table:**
Each host has an IP address which specifies the destination path. Routers use the forwarding table to map a destination IP address to one of its outgoing link in order to transmit the packet to the required destination.

## 1.5 Protocol layers, layering and stacks
- Each protocol layer perform its own function
- Each layer uses services of the layer directly below it
  
### Layering
- The process of layering divides a complex system with numerous functions into multiple layers where each layer perform its own specific function.

**Advantages of layering:**
- improved error handling
- Ability to maintain and update each layer without affecting the entire system

### Protocol stack
Protocol stack is the combination of multiple protocol layers

**Types of protocol stack**
1. Internel protocol stack (vertically simplified version of OSI by reducing the number of layers)
2. Open systems interconnection (OSI)

horizontally simplification = reducing the number of hardware

**Breakdown of layers in the internet protocol stack**
