# 04. Network Layer
- Network layer provides logical communication between two hosts
- The sender encapsulates the segments into datagrams by adding source and destination IP addresses.
- The intermediate host examines the datagram header and perform routing and forwarding of datagrams
- The destination host pass the datagrams to the transport layer
- Internet protocol version 4 and Internet protocol version 6 are examples of protocols in the network layer

## Planes
- A plane is an abstract conception of where certain processes take place.
- Network layer is divided into two planes where each plane plays its own significant role

### Control plane
- The control plane is the part of a network that controls how data packets are forwarded.
- Routing algorithms are run on the control plane to make routing decisions
- It is a network wide function, which menas it needs to gather information about the whole network to determine the most efficient route to transfer the packet

**Two approaches:**
1. Per-router control plane
- A traditional approach implemented in all routers where routing decisions are made by each router
- Each router computes its own forwarding table in a distributed manner.

2. Logically centralized control plane (Software-defined networking, SDN)
- A newer approach implemented through a remote controller.
- Centralized. Each router receives a forwarding table that is computed and distributed by a centralized remote controller.

### Data plane
- Takes the decision from the control plane and implements the decision by sending the packet accordingly.
- It is a local function

## IPv4 Addressing
- IPv4 is a 32 bit address. Thus, it contains 2^32 IP addresses.
- Each interface has an IP address and the address is used to identify the interface
- IPv4 addresses are globally unqiue

### Subnet

### How does a host obtain an IP address?
A host can obtain an IP address through 2 methods:
- IP address assigned staticly by the system admin
- IP address assigned to the host dynamically through DHCP when it joins a network.

### Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
- The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** for IPv4 service automates the assignment of IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other IPv4 networking parameters. This is also known as dynamic addressing.
- It is usually the preferred choice on larger networks, or where the user population changes frequently. New users may arrive and need connections; others may have new computers that must be connected. Rather than use static addressing for each connection, it is more efficient to have IPv4 addresses assigned automatically using DHCP.
- Various types of devices can be DHCP servers. The DHCP server in most medium-to-large networks is usually a local, dedicated PC-based server. With home networks, the DHCP server is usually located on the local router that connects the home network to the ISP.
- DHCP is also used for IPv6. It is known as DHCPv6 and it provides services for IPv6 clients. One important difference is that DHCPv6 does not provide a default gateway address. This can only be obtained dynamically from the Router Advertisement message of the router.

**DHCP lease period**
- DHCP addresses are not permanent. It can allocate IP addresses for a configurable period of time, called a lease period.
- The lease period is an important DHCP setting, When the lease period expires or the DHCP server gets a DHCPRELEASE message the address is returned to the DHCP pool for reuse.
- Thus, Users can freely move from location to location and easily re-establish network connections through DHCP.

**How it works**
- Device requests for an IP address through DHCP settings and it will send an ethernet broadcast (DHCPDISCOVER) to the DHCP server. In the case of a home network, the router is the DHCP server.
- The router will provide a reply (DHCPOFFER) by assigning an appropriate IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server information based on its pool.
- The client may receive multiple DHCPOFFER messages if there is more than one DHCP server on the local network. Therefore, it must choose between them, and sends a DHCP request (DHCPREQUEST) message that identifies the explicit server and lease offer that the client is accepting.
- Assuming that the IPv4 address requested by the client, or offered by the server, is still available, the server returns a DHCP acknowledgment (DHCPACK) message that acknowledges to the client that the lease has been finalized.
- If the offer is no longer valid, then the selected server responds with a DHCP negative acknowledgment (DHCPNAK) message.
- If a DHCPNAK message is returned, then the selection process must begin again with a new DHCPDISCOVER message being transmitted. 
- The DHCP server keeps track on which IP address is assigned to which device by associating the IP address with the device's MAC address.
- As for how the router receives its IP address, it receives it from the ISP DHCP server.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Network address translation (NAT) is a process which converts multiple private IPv4 addresses within a local network into a single public IPv4 address for outside communication. As a result, all local network hosts omly utilize a single IP address to connect to the internet.
- In NAT, a network device often a router or NAT firewall, acts as an intermediary device between the local private network and public network by assigning devices within a private network a single public address.
- The main purpose of implementing NAT is

### Advantages of NAT
- Preservation of public IP addresses. 
- Security. NAT configurations can reveal just one IP address for an entire network to the outside world as part of this capability, effectively hiding the entire internal network and providing additional security. Basically, the hosts inside the local network are not addressable and visible by the outside world.

### NAT process
1. Host with a source network address of 10.0.0.1 and port number of 3345 sends datagram to the destination with a network address of 128.119.40.186 with port number of 80 which is located in another network
2. As the datagram goes through the router, the router will translate the datagram source address from 10.0.0.1 with port number 3345 to a public address of 138.76.29.7 with port number 5001 and update its NAT translation table.
3. When the destination host sends a reply, the destination network address is now 138.76.29.7 with the port number of 5001.
4. As it passes through the router, the router will translate the datagram's destination address back to local host address of 10.0.0.1 with port number of 3345 by refering to the NAT translation table.
5. General rule: Only the port number is unique for each device in the global address. The global IP address is the same for all local hosts.

### Tunneling as a method of translationing from IPv4 to IPv6
- As IPv4 addresses are depleted, there is the need to transition to IPv6. However, IPv6 cannot be incorporated immediately but it needs to be incorporated gradually. The current hardware capabilities of routers are not capable to support IPv6.
- Therefore, tunneling is used to provide downward compatibility with IPv4
- Tunneling is a process of carry IPv6 datagram as a payload in an IPv4 datagram among IPv4 routers. This means the datagram's header is still utilizing IPv4 but the information of IPv6 is stored as the payload. As routers only process the datagram according to the header information, there wil be no issue in tranferring IPv6 datagram through IPv4 routers towards IPv6 routers to be processed as the IPv6 datagrams are carried as an IPv4 payload while the header is still utilizing IPv4.

## Routing algorithms
- Algorithms are a series of steps which are taken with the provision of inputs to produce an output.
- Routing algorithms calculate the least-cost path 

Two types of routing algorithms:
1. Link state algorithm (centralized)
2. Distance vector algorithm (decentralized/Distributed) 

### Link cost
Link cost = cost which needs to be taken account before making a routing decision. There are a combination of factors determines the cost to transfer the packet through a particular link (Eg: badnwidth, distance of the link, energy consumption, throughput, number of hops etc). The link which have the lowest link cost will be chosen.

### Important terms in routing algorithm
N = number of routers in the network
E = links between the routers
D = current cost of path from source to destination
p = previous node

c(u, w) = 5 means the cost of path from u to w is 5

### Link state algorithm
- Monitors the condition of the link to find the least cost path
- Dijkstra's algorithm is used to determine the shortest path between two nodes in the network.

**Djikstra's algorithm**

Initially, the source router only knows the direct connection (the distance to the neighbour router, not the intermediate routers to reach the source router)

Once the source router is connected to the neighbour router, it is considered as one set which means it knows the routers which are connected to both the source router and neighbour routers

if there exists path with the same cost, pick any one of it and it will provide the same result

**Problem of link state algorithm**

Oscillation = constant change in the link cost due to network congestion level. As a result, it will be difficult to calculate the least cost path.

### Distance vector algorithm (DV)
- Distance vector algorithm uses the bellman-ford equation to find the least cost path.
- It calculates all the paths from the source to its neighbour and the paths from the neighbour routers to the destination ,add them together and chooses the lowest cost.
- The amount of calculations which need to be done depends on the number of neighbours

Distance vector algorithm is a decentralized algorithm

each node calculates its own algorithm and shares to the other neighbours
