# Condition structure


## Controlled statement
This following statement is the same as a single if else statement which prints out results.

System.out.println(grade == "A"? "Excellent" : "Good");

## Loops
two types of loops
- counter control loop (we know how many times we want to loop)
- sentinel loop (we do not know how many times we want to loop, it is based on the user's input to enter the magic number/special input to end the loop)

## End of file indicator
If we do not want to use a magic number to end the loop for the sentinel loop, we can use the end of file indicator (input.hasNext())

## while loop
rules to execute a simple while loop
- initalize the counter
- condition to continue the loop
- increment/decrement of the counter or else it will be an infinite loop

while (condition) {

}

## do while loop
In a do while loop, it will execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.

## for loop
for (initial value, condition to continue the loop, increment/decrement) {

}

  ### Enhanced for loop
  it is normally used for arrays

  
  for (int n: numlist) {
    System.out.println("numlist is " + n);
