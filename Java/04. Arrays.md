# 04. Arrays
- An array stores multiple values (elements) in a single memory location. The elements could be both primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.
- Arrays are objects so they are known as reference types
- Each values stored inside the array is located through its index number
- An Array **does not support dymanic resizing** which means it will remain the same length once they are created
- Arrays are **parse by reference.** When the method is called, the caller method transfers the address of the values to the called method. Thus, any changes to the value in the called method will affect the original value in the caller method.
- The elements in an array start with index 0, which means the first element in an array is accessed at index 0 (e.g: array[0], which accesses the first element). Also, as an example, an array of size 5 will only go up to index 4 as the array index starts from 0.

  ### Types of array
  - single dimensional 
  - multi dimensional (able to adjust the rows and columns)
  
## Array declaration

  ### Declaration of array with specific array size
  The following code means we declare an array name numList which is able to store 7 elements
  
  int[ ] numList = new int[7];

  ### Declaration of array with initialization of values
  The following code means we declare an array name numList with 5 elements which are 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50
  
  int[ ] numList = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

## Retrieving elements from an array
We can retrieve specific element from the single dimension array by specifying the index of the array.

## Getting the number of elements in the array
We can use the length method, .length() to return the number of elements in the array.

## Array class
- Array class provides static methods for common array manipulation. This can be done by importing the array class (import java.util.Arrays)

Example of methods:
- sort = sorts the elements of the array in ascending order by default
- binarySearch = returns the position of an element in the array
- equals = compares array
- fill = fills the array with a particular value
- toString =  outputs all the elements of the array in a square bracket separated by a comma

**Example of sort and fill method**

**Example of binarySearch method **

### Multidimensional arrays
Multidimensional arrays are useful when you want to store data as a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns.

  ### Declaration of multidimensional array
  
  **Example 1:**
  - A multidimensional array with the same number of columns in every row can be created with an array creation expression. The following code will produce 3 rows and 4 columns.
  
  int[ ][ ] b = new int [3][4];

  **Example 2:**
  - A multidimensional array in which each row has a different number of columns can be created as follows. The following code creates a two dimensional array with two rows. Row 0 has five columns, and row 1 has three columns.
    
  int [ ][ ] b = new int [2][]; // create 2 rows
  
  b[0] = new int [5]; // create 5 coluns for row 0
  
  b[1] = new int [3]; // create 3 columns for row 1

  ### Accessing elements in a multidimensional array
  To access the elements of the myNumbers array, specify two indexes: one for the array, and one for the element inside that array.

  Example:

  The following code accesses the third element (2) in the second array (1) of myNumbers

  ### Looping through multidimensional array
  We need to use a nested loop (a for loop inside another for loop) to get the elements of a two-dimensional array

## ArrayList
- ArrayList is **similar to array but it supports dynamic resizing (able to change the size during execution to accomodate additional elements)**
- When using arraylist, we need to import arraylist class
- ArrayList only stores reference data type

  ### Declaring arraylist
  ArrayList<reference_data_type> numList = new ArrayList<reference_data_type>();

  ### Common Methods and properties of ArrayList class

  **Example of add, size and get method**

  ### Retrieving values in the arraylist
  We use get method, .get() followed by the index number to get the values in the arraylist

  ### Modifying an element in an arraylist
  We can use the set() method to modify an element in an arraylist. We have to specify the index of the elemnt we want to modify the info followed by the new info

  ### Getting the number of elements in the arraylist
  We can use the size method, .size() to return the number of elements in the arraylist.

  ### Removing all elements in an arraylist
  We can remove all elements in an array by using the .clear() method

## Arrays vs ArrayLists
The table below shows the difference between an array an and arraylist

When we put (... n) in the parameter of the method, it will accept multiple number of parameters as long as it is the same data type
