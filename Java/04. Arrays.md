# 04. Arrays
- An array stores multiple values (elements) in a single memory location. The elements could be both primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.
- Arrays are objects so they are known as reference types
- Each values stored inside the array is located through its index number
- An Array **does not support dymanic resizing** which means it will remain the same length once they are created
- Arrays are **parse by reference.** When the method is called, the caller method transfers the address of the values to the called method. Thus, any changes to the value in the called method will affect the original value in the caller method.

  ### Types of array
  - single dimensional 
  - multi dimensional (able to adjust the rows and columns)
  
## Array declaration

  ### Declaration of array with specific array size
  The following code means we declare an array name numList which is able to store 7 elements
  
  int[ ] numList = new int[7];

  ### Declaration of array with initialization of values
  The following code means we declare an array name numList with 5 elements which are 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50
  
  int[ ] numList = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

  ### Declaration of multidimensional array

  **Example 1:**
  - A multidimensional array with the same number of columns in every row can be created with an array creation expression. The following code will produce 3 rows and 4 columns.
  
  int[ ][ ] b = new int [3][4];

  **Example 2:**
  - A multidimensional array in which each row has a different number of columns can be created as follows. The following code creates a two dimensional array with two rows. Row 0 has five columns, and row 1 has three columns.
    
  int [ ][ ] b = new int [2][5]; // create 2 rows
  
  b[0] = new int [5]; // create 5 coluns for row 0
  
  b[1] = new int [3]; // create 3 columns for row 1


## Retrieving elements from an array
We can retrieve specific element from the single dimension array by specifying the index of the array. The length method (.length) is used to determine the number of elements in the array.

## Array class
- Array class provides static methods for common array manipulation. This can be done by importing the array class (import java.util.Arrays)

Example of methods:
- sort
- binarySearch
- equals
- fill

## Outputting elements in an array
Arrays.toString() will output all the elements in the array in an enclosed bracket separated by a comma.

## ArrayList
- ArrayListis similar to array but it supports dynamic resizing (able to change the size during execution to accomodate additional elements)
- When using arraylist, we need to import arraylist class
- ArrayList only stores reference data type

  ### Declaring arraylist
  ArrayList<reference_data_type> numList = new ArrayList<reference_data_type>();

  ### Retrieving values in the arraylist
  We use get method, .get() to get the values in the arraylist

  ### Getting the number of elements in the arraylist
  We can use the size method, .size() to return the number of elements in the arraylist.

When we put (... n) in the parameter of the method, it will accept multiple number of parameters as long as it is the same data type
