# 04. Arrays
- An array is a single memory location which stores multiple values
- Each values stored inside the array is located through its index number
- Array does not support dymanic resizing which means it's data size cannot be changed

  ### Types of array
  - single dimensional 
  - multi dimensional (able to adjust the rows and columns)
  
## Array declaration

  ### Declaration of array with specific array size
  The following code means we declare an array name numList which is able to store 7 elements
  
  int[] numList = new int[7];

  ### Declaration of array with fixed elements
  The following code means we declare an array name numList with 5 elements which are 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50
  int[] numList = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

## ArrayList
- ArrayList supports dynamic resizing (able to change the size during execution
- ArrayList only stores reference data type

  ### Declaring arraylist
  ArrayList<reference_data_type> numList = new ArrayList<reference_data_type>();

We use .get() to get the values in the arraylist

Arrys.toString() will output all the elements in the array in an enclosed bracket separated by a comma.

When we put (... n) in the parameter of the method, it will accept multiple number of parameters as long as it is the same data type
