# Control structure
There are generally two types of control structures
- selection statement = used to execute an action when the condition is true
- repetition/ looping statement = used to perform statements repeatedly while a loop continuation condition
remains true.

## Selection statement
There are several types of selection statements
- if
- if else
- if else if
- switch

  ### if selection statement 
  - For if selection statement, it will execute the block of codesif the condition is met. If the condition is not met, it will skip the block of codes.
  - It is a Single selection statement which means it selects or ignores a single action or group of actions.
  
  **Example:**
  
  if (condition ) {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
  }
  
  ### if else selection statement
  - In an if else selection statement, it performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action if the condition is false.
  - It is a double selection statement which means it selects between two different actions
  or groups of actions.
  
  **Example:**
  
  if (condition) {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
  }
  
  else {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
    }
  
  ### if else if selection statement
  - It is a multiple selection statement which means it selects among many different actions or groups of actions. If the condition is not met, it will check another condition.
  - If all the conditions are not met, it will execute the block of codes under the else statement.

  Example:

  if (condition) {
  
    block_of_codes;

  }

  else if (condition) {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  else if (condition) {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  else {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  ### Switch selection statement
  - Switch selection statement is identical to if else if selection statement in a way that it is a muiltiple selection statement. However, the main difference is that a switch selection statement cannot accept a range of values, it can only compare single values.
  - Be sure to insert break keyword at the end of the code of each case to break out of the switch block once the case is met or it will execute other case as well.
  - The default keyword specifies some codes to run if there is no case match.

## Conditional operator
Conditional operator is very handy as it allows us to print the output of an if else statement in a single line of code 

**Example:**

## Loops
There are two types of repetitions:
- counter control repetition (we know how many times we want to loop)
- sentinel repetition (we do not know how many times we want to loop, it is based on the user's input to enter the magic number/special input to end the loop)

## End of file indicator
- If we do not want the user to use a magic number to end the loop for the sentinel loop, we can use the end of file indicator (input.hasNext())
- When using end of file indicator, the user has to enter ctrl d to end the loop if his/her OS is UNIX/Linux/MAC OS
- When using end of file indicator, the user has to enter ctrl z to end the loop if his/her OS is Windows

## while loop
rules to execute a simple while loop
- initalize the counter
- condition to continue the loop
- increment/decrement of the counter or else it will be an infinite loop

while (condition) {

  block_of_codes;
  
}

## do while loop
In a do while loop, it will execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.

do {

  block_of_codes;

}

while (condition);


## for loop
for (initial value, condition to continue the loop, increment/decrement) {

}

  ### Enhanced for loop
  Enhanced for loop is normally used to obtain elements contained in an array. It iterates through the elements of an array without using a counter and assigns the elements to the variable.

  
  for (int n: numlist) {
  
    System.out.println("numlist is " + n);

## Break statement
- The break statement is used to exit the switch statement and exit a loop
- Break statement can be used in while and for loops

  ### Example of using a break statement to exit a for loop
  When i is 4, it will exit the for loop

## Continue statement
- The continue statement skips one loop by breaking one iteration in the loop if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
- Continue statement can be used in while and for loops

### Example of using a continue statement in a for loop
When i is 4, it will skip the loop and continue with the next loop.
