# Control structure
There are generally two types of control structures
- selection statement = used to execute an action when the condition is true
- repetition/ looping statement = used to perform statements repeatedly while a loop continuation condition
remains true.

## Selection statement
There are several types of selection statements
- if
- if else
- if else if
- switch

  ### if selection statement 
  - For if selection statement, it will execute the block of codesif the condition is met. If the condition is not met, it will skip the block of codes.
  - It is a Single selection statement which means it selects or ignores a single action or group of actions.
  
  **Example:**
  
  if (condition ) {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
  }
  
  ### if else selection statement
  - In an if else selection statement, it performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action if the condition is false.
  - It is a double selection statement which means it selects between two different actions
  or groups of actions.
  
  **Example:**
  
  if (condition) {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
  }
  
  else {
  
    block_of_codes;
  
    }
  
  ### if else if selection statement
  - It is a multiple selection statement which means it selects among many different actions or groups of actions. If the condition is not met, it will check another condition.
  - If all the conditions are not met, it will execute the block of codes under the else statement.

  Example:

  if (condition) {
  
    block_of_codes;

  }

  else if (condition) {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  else if (condition) {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  else {

    block_of_codes;

  }

  ### Switch selection statement
  - Switch selection statement is identical to if else if selection statement in a way that it is a muiltiple selection statement. However, the main difference is that a switch selection statement cannot accept a range of values, it can only compare single values.
  - Be sure to insert break keyword at the end of the code of each case to break out of the switch block once the case is met or it will execute other case as well.
  - The default keyword specifies some codes to run if there is no case match.

## Conditional operator
Conditional operator is very handy as it allows us to print the output of an if else statement in a single line of code 

**Example:**
