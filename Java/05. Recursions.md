# 05. Recursions
- Used to solve questions with similar pattern
- recursive function = a function that calls itself.

## Components in a recursion
- base case (for stopping the repetition)
- step down (repetition)


## How recursion works
It will keep calling the function until it meets the base case. After that, it will return the values to all the previous functions which are called.
