# 05. Recursions
- Used to solve questions with similar pattern
- recursive function = a function that calls itself.

## Components in a recursion
- base case (for stopping the repetition)
- step down (repetition)

## How recursion works
It will keep calling the function until it meets the base case. After that, it will return the results to the previous functions which are called and this continues all the way up until the main function.
