# 03. Methods
- Methods are also known as functions. The block of code only runs when the method is called.
- **All variables defined in methods are local variable** which means they are known only in the function which they are defined.
- only a static method can call another static method

## Why use methods?
- It makes the program more manageable and simple
- It avoids repetition of codes in a program
- Packaging code as a function allows the code to be executed from several locations in a program simply by calling the
method.

## Main method
- The main method is called automatically by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when you execute an application. The whole program will not be able to be executed without a main method.
- The main method contains other methods

  ### Header of main method
  **Example: public static void main(String [] args)**
  - public = access modifier
  - void = return value type
  - main = method name
  - void = Void return value type means the method will not return any value.
  - (String [] args) = accept string arguments


arguments/parameters = used to tranfer data

one method can only return one value

to call a method, we just type the method name

once a method is called, it will execute the codes under the method called, and return to the 

## Declaring methods
There are 4 main important components when declaring the method:
- access modifier
- return value type = data type of the result returned
- method name = The name of the method
- parameter = A comma separated list that specifies the data received by the function when it is called. If a method does not receive any values, it can be empty. Do take note that each parameter listed must be accompanied with a data type.

The combination of these four components are known as the method header.

## Parameters and arguments
  ### Parameters
  - Parameters **act as variables inside the method.**
  - Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. We can **add multiple parameters by separating them with a comma.**

  Note: When we are working with multiple parameters, the **method call must have the same number of arguments as there are parameters**, and the **arguments must be passed in the same order.**

  ### Arguments
  - Arguments are parameters which are passed to a method
  - In this case, Liam, Jenny and Anja are arguments while fname is the parameter.

  ## Passing parameters to methods
  There are generally two ways of passing parameters to methods
  - pass by value 
  - pass by reference

    ### Pass by value (call by value)
    - Pass by value is used by primitive data type.
    - It works by **copying the argument's value and passing it to the method which is called.**
    - The **changes made to the variable value of the called method do not affect the original caller's variable value.** original value is transferred to the method but if we change the value in the method, it will not affect the original value in the main method)
   
    ### Pass by reference (call by reference)
    - Pass by reference is used by reference data type.
    - The **called method can access the argumentâ€™s value in the caller directly and modify that data**, if necessary.
    - It **improves performance by eliminating the need to copy possibly large amounts of data.**
    
  ## Return values
  The void return value type indicates that the method does not return a value. If we want the method to return a value, we can **use a primitive data type (such as int, char, etc.) instead of void**, and use the **return keyword inside the method:**

  **Returning the sum using a single parameter**
