# 03. Methods
- also known as functions
- All variables defined in methods are local variable

Main method contains other methods

arguments/parameters = used to tranfer data

one method can only return one value

to call a method, we just type the method name

only a static method can call another static method

once a method is called, it will execute the codes under the method called, and return to the 

## Defining methods
There are 4 main components when defining methods:
- access modifier
- return value type
- method name
- parameter

Eg: public static void main
public = access modifier
void = return value type
main = method name
void return value type means the method will not return any value
(String [] args) = accept string arguments

## Parameters
when defining parmeters in the method, we must define the data type

  ### Passing parameters to methods
  - pass by value (used by primitive data type) (original value is transferred to the method but if we change the value in the method, it will not affect the original value in the main method)
  - pass by reference
