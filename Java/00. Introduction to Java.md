# 00. Introduction to Java

## Difference between Java and C/C++
- In a compliler language, the source code is directly compiled into machine code by the machine whereas for interpreter language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
- Java is an interpreter language whereas C/C++ is a compiler language.
- Hence, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required which allows the ability to perform java programming as well as compiling of java code.
- In Java, the compiler will compile the source code (.java file) into a bytecode (.class file). The bytecode is then converted into the machine code through the java virtual machine (JVM).

## JRE vs JDK
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) consists of everything necessary to run acompiled Java program, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library,
the java command, and other infrastructure. However, it cannot be used to create new programs.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured SDK (software development kit) for Java. It contains everything the JRE has, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is capable of
creating and compiling programs.

## Compiling source code without the usage of any IDE
We can use the command line to compile source code to machine code/ execute bytecode without any IDE but only using the command prompt.

  ### Compiling C/C++ source code to machine code
  Type **gcc file.c -o file.exe** in the terminal, -o means to output

  ### Compile java source file to bytecode
  Type in **javac file.java** in the command prompt

  ### Executing the java bytecode
  Type in **java followed by the file name**

## Java syntax
- Every java program has a class name which must match the filename and a main method.
- Java is a case sensitive language
- Every statement must end with a semicolon

  ### Class name
  - In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
  - A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
  - Every line of code that run in Java must be inside a class.
  
  Eg: public class Main { // the class name is Main
  
  } 

  ### Main method
  The **main()** method is also required in every Java program. Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

  Eg: public static void main(String [] args) {

  }

## Comments
- Leaving comments in your code is a good practice to ease up code readability as it notifies people what is the function of the code and how the code works.
- There are two types of comments, single line comment and multi-line comment.

 ### Single-line comment
 We use // to write a single-line comment.

 ### Multi-line comment
 We use /* */ to write a multi-line comment.

## Output / print text or values
- We can use **print() method or println() method to output values or print text in Java.**
- **When printing text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks ""**.

  ### print() method vs println() method
  - The main difference between println() and print() method is println() will add a new line at the end of the output whereas print() do not add a new line at the end of the output.
  - Syntax for print(): System.out.print()
  - Syntax for println(): System.out.println()

## Data types

  ### Primitive data type
  - Primitive types are the basic types of data.
  - Primitive data type starts with a lowercase letter and they always contain a value
  - Primitive variables store primitive values
  - Example : boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double
  
  **int** = stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
  **float** = stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99. The value must end with a letter f.
  double = stores floating point numbers, with decimals up to 15 decimal points. The value must end with a letter d.
  **char** = stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
  **boolean** = stores values in two states: true or false

  ### Reference data type
  - Reference types are any instantiable class as well as arrays
  - Reference data type starts with an uppercase letter and they can be null
  - Reference variables store addresses
  - example : String, Scanner, Random, Integer, Double, etc.
  
  **String** = stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes.

## Conversion of data types

  ### String to integer
  We can use **Integer.parseInt() or Integer.valueOf()** to convert a string to an integer.

  ### Integer to string
  We can use **Integer.toString()** to convert an integer to String.

  ### Widening casting (conversion of smaller data type range to a larger data type range)
  In widening casting, conversion is done automatically.

  ### Narrowing casting (conversion of larger data type range to a smaller data type range)
  In narrowing casting, conversion is done manaually by placong parenthesis in front of the value. 

  Eg:
  int num = 10;

  double price;

  num = (int) price;

## Variables
- Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program.
- Every variable must have a name, a data type and a value.
- When a new value is placed into a variable, the new value replaces the previous value and the previous value will be lost. However, if we do not want to overwrite existing values, we can use the final keyword which will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only.

## Declaring and initializing

  ### Declaration of multiple variables
  - All the variables of a program must be declared to be used.
  - Declaration of a variable serves two purposes: It **associates a type and an identifier (or name) with the variable.**
  - We can **use a comma-separated list to declare more than one variable of the same type.**

  ### Assignment of one identical value to multiple variables
  We can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.

  ### Initializing
  providing the correct initial value to the variable
