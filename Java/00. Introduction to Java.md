# 00. Introduction to Java

## Difference between Java and C/C++
- In a compliler language, the source code is directly compiled into machine code by the machine whereas for interpreter language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
- Java is an interpreter language whereas C/C++ is a compiler language.
- Hence, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required which allows the ability to perform java programming as well as compiling of java code.
- In Java, the compiler will compile the source code (.java file) into a bytecode (.class file). The bytecode is then converted into the machine code through the java virtual machine (JVM).

## JRE vs JDK
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) consists of everything necessary to run acompiled Java program, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library,
the java command, and other infrastructure. However, it cannot be used to create new programs.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured SDK (software development kit) for Java. It contains everything the JRE has, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is capable of
creating and compiling programs.

## Compiling source code without the usage of any IDE
We can use the command line to compile source code to machine code/ execute bytecode without any IDE but only using the command prompt.

  ### Compiling C/C++ source code to machine code
  Type **gcc file.c -o file.exe** in the terminal, -o means to output

  ### Compile java source file to bytecode
  Type in **javac file.java** in the command prompt

  ### Executing the java bytecode
  Type in **java followed by the file name**

## Java syntax
- Every java program has a class name which must match the filename and a main method.
- Java is a case sensitive language
- Every statement must end with a semicolon

  ### Class name
  - In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
  - A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
  - Every line of code that run in Java must be inside a class.
  
  Eg: public class Main { // the class name is Main
  
  } 

  ### Main method
  The **main()** method is also required in every Java program. Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

  Eg: public static void main(String [] args) {

  }

## Comments
- Leaving comments in your code is a good practice to ease up code readability as it notifies people what is the function of the code and how the code works.
- There are two types of comments, single line comment and multi-line comment.

 ### Single-line comment
 We use // to write a single-line comment.

 ### Multi-line comment
 We use /* */ to write a multi-line comment.

## Output / print text or values
- We can use **print() method or println() method to output values or print text in Java.**
- **When printing text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks ""**.

  ### print() method vs println() method
  - The main difference between println() and print() method is println() will add a new line at the end of the output whereas print() do not add a new line at the end of the output.
  - Syntax for print(): System.out.print()
  - Syntax for println(): System.out.println()

## Data types

  ### Primitive data type
  - Primitive types are the basic types of data.
  - Primitive data type starts with a lowercase letter and they always contain a value
  - Primitive variables store primitive values
  - Example : boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double

    ### Primitive number types
  - **double** = stores floating point numbers, with decimals up to 15 decimal points. The value must end with a letter d.
  - **float** = stores floating point numbers, with decimals up to 7 decimal points. Eg: 19.99 or -19.99. The value must end with a letter f.
  - **long** = store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. The value must end with a letter L.
  - **int** = stores integers whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
  - **short** = stores whole numbers from -32768 to 32767.
  - **byte** = stores smaller range of whole numbers from -128 to 127.

    ### Primitive character types
  - **char** = stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.

    ### Boolean data type
  - **boolean** = stores values in two states which are true or false

  ### Reference data type
  - Reference types are any instantiable class as well as arrays
  - Reference data type starts with an uppercase letter and they can be null
  - Reference variables store addresses
  - Reference data types can be **used to call methods to perform certain operations.**
  - Example : **String, Scanner, Random, Integer, Double, etc.**

    ### String
    - String is a reference data type which used for storing text. As it is a reference data type, it **can call methods to perform certain operations on strings such as length() method, toUpperCase() method and toLowerCase() method.** 
    - When using String data type, the text are surrounded by double quotes.

      ### String methods
        ### Length() method
        The length() method is used to find the length of a string.

        ### toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() method
        The **toUpperCase() converts the string to uppercase** whereas **toLowerCase() converts the string to lowercase**

        ### indexOf() method
        The indexOf() method returns the index (the position) of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string which 
        includes whitespace

      ### String concatenation
      String concatenation is the process of combining multiple strings together. We can perform string concatenation by using the **+** operator or by using the **concat()** method.

      **String concatenation using + operator**

      An empty text (" ") is added to create a space between firstName and lastName when printing.

      ### Adding string with number
      Whenever we add a string with a number, the **result will be a string concatenation.**

      ### Escape sequences
      Escape sequence is used to perform specific task which could avoid noramlly cause errors such as printing a quote etc

## Conversion of data types

![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/7c8beefc-6787-4980-9e3c-88c0882d8481)
 
  ### String to integer
  We can use **Integer.parseInt() or Integer.valueOf()** to convert a string to an integer.

  ### Integer to string
  We can use **Integer.toString()** to convert an integer to String.

  ### Widening casting (conversion of smaller primitive data type range to a larger primitive data type range)
  In widening casting, conversion is done automatically.

  ![image](https://github.com/Fong20/Learning-repository/assets/150316121/fe8e8879-4467-4d23-95db-93b562d77986)

  ### Narrowing casting (conversion of larger primitive data type range to a smaller primitive data type range)
  In narrowing casting, conversion is done manaually by placong parenthesis in front of the value. 

  Eg:
  int num = 10;

  double price;

  num = (int) price;

## Variables
- Variables are used to **represent values that may be changed in the program.**
- Every variable must have a name, a data type and a value.
- When a new value is placed into a variable, the new value replaces the previous value and the previous value will be lost. However, if we do not want to overwrite existing values, we can use the final keyword which will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only.

## Identifiers
- Identifiers are basically names that identify elements such as classes, methods and even variables in a program.
- Identifiers can be short names (x, y) or even descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume etc). It is recommended to use descriptive names as it is easier to understand the code.

  ### Rules for naming
  - Names can **contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs**
  - Names must **begin with a lowercase letter and cannot contain whitespace**
  - Names can also begin with $ and _ 
  - Names are case-sensitive ( Eg: "myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int, boolean, class) cannot be used as names
    
## Declaring and initializing

  ### Declaration of multiple variables
  - All the variables of a program must be declared to be used.
  - Declaration of a variable serves two purposes: It **associates a type and an identifier (or name) with the variable.**
  - We can **use a comma-separated list to declare more than one variable of the same type.**

  ### Assignment of one identical value to multiple variables
  We can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.

  ### Initializing
  providing the correct initial value to the variable

## Operators
- Operators are used to **perform operations on variables and values.**
- Eg: Arithmetic operators, Assignment operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators, Bitwise operators

  ### Arithmetic operators
  Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

  ### Assignment operators
  Assignment operators are used to **assign values to variables.**

  ### Comparison operators
  - Comparison operators are used to **compare two values (or variables).** This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
  - It will return the value of a comparison in the form of boolean values (true or false).

  ### Logical operators
  - Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
  - It will also return the value of comparison in the form
