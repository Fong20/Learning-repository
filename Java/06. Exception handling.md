# 06. Exception Handling
- Exception = an indication of a problem that occurs during a program’s execution.
- With exception handling, a program can continue executing (rather than terminating) after dealing with a
problem.
- Stack trace = Information regarding the exception (Name of the exception and where it occurs)

## How to provide exception handling?
- We use the try block and catch block
- The try block comprises of code that might throw an exception. it consists of the keyword try followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces.
- The catch block catches and handles an exception
- The finally block will always executed regardless of the condition of the try catch block
- To handle any exceptions, we use (exception) in the catch block.

  InputMismatchException = user enters wrong data type
  ArithmeticException = divide by 0
  ArrayIndexOutOfBound = happens when we are trying to access index wh

## Files
- Data stored in variables and arrays is temporary. It’s lost when a local variable goes out of scope or when the
program terminates
- For long term retention of data, computers use files.
- File streams can be used to input and output data as bytes or characters.

  ### Text
  - Streams that input and output characters are known as character based streams , representing data as a sequence of characters.
  - Files created using character based streams are referred to as text files . Text files can be read by text editors.

  ### Binary
  - Streams that input and output bytes are known as byte based streams , representing data in its binary format.
  - Files that are created using byte based streams are referred to as binary files
  - Binary files are read by programs that understand the specific content of the file and the ordering of that content.

  ### Writing content to a file and reading contents from the file
  When writing contents to the file and reading contents from the file, we need to use try catch to handle the FileNotFoundException
  
    ### Writing contents to the file
    - To write stuff into the text file, we need to use the formatter class.
    - If we don't specify where is the file path, it will create a text file under the same path as your java file
  
    ### Reading contents from the file
