# 06. Exception Handling and files

## Exception handling
- Exception = an indication of a problem that occurs during a program’s execution.
- With exception handling, a **program can continue executing (rather than terminating) after dealing with a
problem.**
- Stack trace = Information regarding the exception (Name of the exception and where it occurs)

  ### How to provide exception handling?
  - We use the **try block and catch block**
  - The **try block comprises of code that might throw an exception.** it consists of the keyword try followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces.
  - The **catch block catches and handles an exception.** It **begins with the keyword catch and is followed by an
  exception parameter in parentheses and a block of code enclosed in curly braces.**
  - The **exception parameter identifies the exception type the handler can process.**
  - The **finally block will always executed regardless of the condition of the try catch block**
  - At least one catch block or a finally block must immediately follow the try block.

  ### Common exceptions of Java runtime exceptions
  - InputMismatchException = user enters wrong data type
  - ArithmeticException = arithmetic error such as divide by 0
  - ArrayIndexOutOfBound = happens when we are trying to access index which is outside of the array's size

  **The exception method is the general way used to handle any exceptions**

## Files
- Data stored in variables and arrays is temporary. It’s lost when a local variable goes out of scope or when the
program terminates
- For long term retention of data, computers use files.
- File streams can be used to input and output data as bytes or characters.

  ### Text
  - Streams that input and output characters are known as character based streams , representing data as a sequence of characters.
  - **Files created using character based streams are referred to as text files.** Text files can be read by text editors.

  ### Binary
  - Streams that input and output bytes are known as byte based streams , representing data in its binary format.
  - **Files that are created using byte based streams are referred to as binary files**
  - **Binary files are read by programs that understand the specific content of the file and the ordering of that content.**

  ### Writing content to a file and reading contents from the file
  - One general rule which is required when writing content and reading content from the file is to use try catch to handle the FileNotFoundException 
  - If we don't specify where is the file path, it will create a text file under the same folder as your java file

    ### Writing contents to a text file using java.util.Formatter class
    - To write content into the text file, we need to declare the formatter class (java.util.Formatter) followed by the text file path.
    - Check if the file is opened. Close the file if the file is open or else the data will not be inserted to the text file.

  ### Writing contents to a text file using java.io.FileWriter class
  - To write contents into a text file using the FileWriter class, we need to import the FileWriter class (java.io.FileWriter) and use the write() method to write the contents into the text file.
  - An important aspect to remember is to close it with the close() method or the data will not be inserted to the text file.

    ### Reading contents from the file using the scanner class
    - To read contents from the file using the scanner class, we need to import the java file class (java.io.File) and the scanner class.

### Deleting text files
To delete a file in Java, we need to import the java file class (java.io.File) and use the delete() method.
