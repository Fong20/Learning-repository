# 06. Exception Handling and files

## Exception handling
- Exception = an indication of a problem that occurs during a program’s execution.
- With exception handling, a **program can continue executing (rather than terminating) after dealing with a
problem.**
- Stack trace = Information regarding the exception (Name of the exception and where it occurs)

  ### How to provide exception handling?
  - We use the **try block and catch block**
  - The **try block comprises of code that might throw an exception.** it consists of the keyword try followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces.
  - The **catch block catches and handles an exception.** It **begins with the keyword catch and is followed by an
  exception parameter in parentheses and a block of code enclosed in curly braces.**
  - The **exception parameter identifies the exception type the handler can process.**
  - The **finally block will always executed regardless of the condition of the try catch block**
  - At least one catch block or a finally block must immediately follow the try block.

  ### Common exceptions of Java runtime exceptions
  - InputMismatchException = user enters wrong data type
  - ArithmeticException = arithmetic error such as divide by 0
  - ArrayIndexOutOfBound = happens when we are trying to access index out from the array's size

  **The exception method is the general way used to handle any exceptions**

## Files
- Data stored in variables and arrays is temporary. It’s lost when a local variable goes out of scope or when the
program terminates
- For long term retention of data, computers use files.
- File streams can be used to input and output data as bytes or characters.

  ### Text
  - Streams that input and output characters are known as character based streams , representing data as a sequence of characters.
  - **Files created using character based streams are referred to as text files.** Text files can be read by text editors.

  ### Binary
  - Streams that input and output bytes are known as byte based streams , representing data in its binary format.
  - **Files that are created using byte based streams are referred to as binary files**
  - **Binary files are read by programs that understand the specific content of the file and the ordering of that content.**

  ### Writing content to a file and reading contents from the file
  One general rule which is required when writing content and readimg content from the file is to use try catch to handle the FileNotFoundException

    ### Writing contents to a text file
    - To write content into the text file, we need to import java.util.* and declare the formatter class followed by the text file path.
    - If we don't specify where is the file path, it will create a text file under the same folder as your java file
    - Check if the file is opened. Close the file if the file is open or else the data will not be inserted to the text file.

    ### Reading contents from the file
    - To read contents from the file, we need to import java.io.File and the scanner class.
