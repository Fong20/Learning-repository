## Loops
Loops are used to repeat the execution of a block of code when the condition is met

Components in a simple loop
- initial counter
- condition to continue the loop
- increment/decrement of the counter or else it will be an infinite loop.

There are two types of repetitions:
- **counter control repetition (we know how many times we want to loop)**
- **sentinel control repetition (we do not know how many times we want to loop, it is based on the user's input to enter the magic number/special input to end the loop)**
  
## End of file indicator
- If we do not want the user to use a magic number to end the loop for the sentinel loop, we can use the end of file indicator (.hasNext())
- When using end of file indicator, the user has to enter ctrl d to end the loop if his/her OS is UNIX/Linux/MAC OS
- When using end of file indicator, the user has to enter ctrl z to end the loop if his/her OS is Windows

## while loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

Example:

The following code will continue looping and print out the value of i when the value of i is less than 5

## do while loop
In a do while loop, it will execute the code block at least once before checking the condition.

## for loop
The for loop is used when we know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code.

**General syntax:**

Example:

1. Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0).
2. Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.
3. Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

  ### Enhanced for loop
  Enhanced for loop is normally used to obtain elements contained in an array. It iterates through the elements of an array without using a counter and assigns the elements to the variable.

  
  for (int n: numlist) {
  
    System.out.println("numlist is " + n);

## Nested loops
- Nested loops are formed by placing a loop inside another loop. The inner loop will be executed
- The inner loop will be executed for each iteration of the outer loop.

Example:

## Break statement
- The break statement is used to exit the switch statement and exit a loop
- Break statement can be used in while and for loops

  ### Example of using a break statement to exit a for loop
  When i is 4, it will exit the for loop

## Continue statement
- The continue statement skips one loop by breaking one iteration in the loop if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
- Continue statement can be used in while and for loops

### Example of using a continue statement in a for loop
When i is 4, it will skip the loop and continue with the next loop.
