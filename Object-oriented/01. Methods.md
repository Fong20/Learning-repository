# 01. Methods

## Java API Packages
Java Application Programming Interface (API) Java API, is a set of predefined classes, interfaces, and methods that provide ready-made functionality for developers to use in their Java applications.

## Static methods
- Static methods are not tied to any objects. Thus, we can directly access the method without the need to create an object.
- To declare a static method , place the keyword static before the return type in the methodâ€™s declaration.

**Example: Math class**

Math.max(20, 40);

## Generating random numbers
There are two ways to generate a random number
- using the static method name random of the Math class,  Math.random()
- creating an object of the random class 

### Using the static method name random of the Math class
By using the Math.random() class, it will return a double value
