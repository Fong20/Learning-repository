# 04. Inheritance and polymorphism

## Inheritance (is a relationship)
- Inheritance is also known as (Specilization/Generalization)
- Inheritance is used for software reusability whereby the new class is created by absorbing an existing class's members and enhancing them with additional or modified capabilities
- In an inheritance (is a) relationship, an object of a subclass can be treated as an object of a parent class (superclass)

  **Important terms in inheritance:**
  1. Parent class / superclass = The class that contains the common properties which are found in the sub classes
  2. Sub class = Class which is derived from the parent class and has its own additional unique properties

- In Java, it only supports single inheritance which means that one subclass can only have one parent class
- The default parent class for all classes is the java.lang.Object when we did not specify which class parent class extends the subclass

  **Syntax:**

  class a extends class b, class a is the subclass, class b is the parent class

**Example:**

Inheritance is represented by a hollow triangle. The following diagram means:
- a car is a vehicle
- a truck is a vehicle

### Super keyword
- **The main function of the super keyword is used by the sub class to access the properties of the parent class**
- **When we create an inheritance, the constructor of the parent class is not automatically inherited.** We need explicitly call the parent class constructor to initialize the values by using the super keyword. of the attribute or else java will call the default constructor with no arguments.
- The super keyword must be the first line of code in the constructor
- Another function of the super keyword is used to differentiate which method is being called (own class method or the method which belongs to the parent class, this is normally found in method override)


### Overloading vs Overiding
Overload: 
- two methods in the same class which have the same method name but has different method signature (order, type, number of parameters)

Override: 
- **Two methods in different class (super/sub class) which have the same method name and same signature.** Override only occurs in inheritance.
- Override can be done by creating the same method which is found in the parent class in the sub class 

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows us to design and implement systems that are easily extensible.
- Polymorphism requires the use of inheritance

**2 types of polymorphism**
1. static (method overloading)
2. dynamic (method overriding)

   ### Dynamic polymorphism
   Dynamic polymorphism allows us to write programs such that the objects created share the same superclass as if they all are all the objects of the superclass. This can be achieved by using method overriding in which the same method name but they perform different task. 

 ### instance of and downcasting
 - When we insert multiple objects of different class into an arraylist which accept the parent class, instance of is used to check if the object belongs to a specific class
 - downcasting is used to cast a subclass to the parent class to access the method of the subclass
