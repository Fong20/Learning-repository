# 04. Inheritance and polymorphism

## Inheritance (is a relationship)
- Inheritance is also known as (Specilization/Generalization)
- Inheritance is used for software reusability whereby the new class is created by absorbing

  **Important terms in inheritance:**
  1. Parent class / superclass = The class that contains the common properties which are found in the sub classes
  2. Sub class = Class which is derived from the parent class and has its own additional unique properties

- In Java, it only supports single inheritance which means that one subclass can only have one parent class
- The default parent class for all classes is the java.lang.Object when we did not specify which class parent class extends the subclass

  **Syntax:**

  class a extends class b, class a is the subclass, class b is the parent class

**Example:**

Inheritance is represented by a hollow triangle. The following diagram means:
- a car is a vehicle
- a truck is a vehicle

### Super keyword
- **The main function of the super keyword is used by the sub class to access the properties of the parent class**
- **When we create an inheritance, the constructor of the parent class is not automatically inherited.** We need explicitly call the parent class constructor to initialize the values by using the super keyword. of the attribute or else java will call the default constructor with no arguments.


### Overloading vs Overriding
Overload: two methods in the same class which have the same method name but different method signature (order, type, number of parameters)

Override: 
- Two methods in different class (super/sub class) which have the same method name and same signature. Override only occurs in inheritance.
- Override can be done by creating the same class which is found in the parent class in the sub class
