# 01. Methods in depth

## Java API Packages
- Java Application Programming Interface (API) Java API, is **a set of predefined classes, interfaces, and methods that provide ready-made functionality for developers to use in their Java applications.**
- These predefined classes are grouped into categories of related classes called packages .

**Common Java API packages**

## Static methods
- Static methods are not tied to any objects. Thus, we can directly access the method without the need to create an object.
- To declare a static method , place the keyword static before the return type in the methodâ€™s declaration.

**Example: Math class**

Math.max(20, 40);

## Declaring methods
There are generally three ways to declare a method

## Random numbers
Random numbers are generated starting from the value of 0 unless the shifting value is provided

**There are two ways to generate a random number**
- using the static method name random of the Math class,  Math.random()
- creating an object of the random class 

### Using the Math.random() method
By using the Math.random() method, it returns a random number with a double data type between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive)

To generate a random number of a specific range, we need to provide the first value + Math.random() and * last value.

### Creating an object of the random class 
The object of the random class can produce random boolean, byte, float, double, int and long values.

Firstly, we need to import the java class, java.util.Random(). Next, we need to construct an object to access the random class

To generate a random number of a specific range, we need to provide the shifting value and the scaling factor
- shifting value = First value of the random value
- scaling factor = Specifies the number of random values to be generated

face = randomNumbers.nextInt(6) will provide random number from 0 to 5 whereas face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6) will provide random numbers from 1 to 6

## Method overloading
- **Method overloading is used to create several methods with the same name which perform similar tasks but with different types of arguments or differnet number of arguments.**
- As a result, the method can be extended with the same name but with different implementation. It also improves code readability and maintainability.
- **The compiler distinguishes overloaded methods by their signatures**

  ### Signature of a method
  1. method name
  2. number of parameters
  3. data type of parameters
  4. order of the parameter
   
  ### Characteristics of an overloaded method
- Same method name declared in the same class
- Different number of parameter
- Different data type of the parameter
- Different order of parameter
  
Note: **Java does not consider the difference in return data type as method overloading.** it only considers the number of parameter, data type of the parameter and order of parameters as criterias for method overloading. **The difference in the variable name of the parameter is also not a method overloading.**

**Example:**

## Constructor overloading
Constructor overloading is similar to method overloading but it applies to the constructor.
