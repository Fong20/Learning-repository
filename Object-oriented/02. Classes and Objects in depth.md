# 02. Classes and Objects in depth

## Throw and catch exceptions
- Provides more flexibility for the class by throwing back an exception object to the caller.
- Use throw exceptions in the model class and use the try catch in the driver class to handle the exception throwed.

**Syntax:**

throw new IllegalArgumentException("custom message");

## Static class members
- Static is used when we need to share the same value across the whole object. This can be done by using the static keyword.
- Static can be applied to both variables and methods

### Applying static to variables/attributes/fields
- **instance variable** = each variable occupies different memory location for each object
- **class variable** = Variable which is declared with a static keyword. As a result, all variables of the objects of a class share the same value as they are stored at the same memory location

### Applying static to methods
When we set the method to static, instead of calling the method through the object, we call the method through its class name as the values are now applied to the class, not to specific objects.

**In the following code, we have set the setColor() method to static. Hence, we need to call the method through the class name Car.setColor()** **An argumnent "green" has been provided Car.setColor("green") which will apply the argument "green" to all the objects.**

**Example 1: Using static to count the number of objects**

A public class variable name total is declared and inserted into the constructor. The increment is used to increment the variable everytime an object is created. Since the class variable is has a public access modifier, we can directly call it through its variable name Car.total()

**If the class variable has a private access modifier, we need to create a getter method getTotal() to return the value of the total variable. We then call it through the getter name Car.getTotal()**

**Example 2: Using static to store the ID of an employee**

  ### Importing static methods
  We can import all static methods (static import on demand) or only certain static methods (single static import)

  **General syntax to import particular static method**
  
  import static packageName ClassName staticMethodName;

  **General syntax to import all static method**

  import static packageName ClassName.*;
  
  **Example:**
  
  The following code "import static java.lang.Math.* imports all the static method of the math class.

## this keyword
**this() keyword is used to reduce the number of code duplication** whereby t**he constructors with the this() keyword calls and passes the parameters to the complete constructor** 

**Syntax:**

this(arguments);

**Example:**

In the following code, the first three constructors with this() keyword will call and pass the parameters into the complete construcor.
