# 02. Classes and Objects in depth

## Throw and catch exceptions
- Provides more flexibility for the class by throwing back an exception object to the caller.
- Use throw exceptions in the model class and use the try catch in the driver class to handle the exception throwed.

**Syntax:**

throw new IllegalArgumentException("custom message");

## Static class members
- Static is used when we need to share the same value across the whole object. This can be done by using the static keyword.
- Static can be applied to both variables and methods

### Applying static to variables/attributes/fields
- **instance variable** = each variable occupies different memory location for each object
- **class variable** = Variable which is declared with a static keyword. As a result, all variables of the objects of a class share the same value as they are stored at the same memory location

### Applying static to methods
- When we set the method to static, it is known as an class method. When calling a class method, instead of calling the method through the object, we call the method through its class name as the values are now applied to the class, not to specific objects.
- **A class method can only manipulate class variable and call another class method in the same class**, it cannot maniupulate the instance variable and call an instance method in the same class. This is because a static method applies all the variables and methods to the whole class instead of a single object. Thus, if we try to change an instance variable or call an instance method, it does not know which value of the instance variable or the instance method is refering to which object.

**In the following code, we have set the setColor() method to static. Hence, we need to call the method through the class name Car.setColor()** **An argumnent "green" has been provided Car.setColor("green") which will apply the argument "green" to all the objects.**

**Example 1: Using static to count the number of objects**

A public class variable name total is declared and inserted into the constructor. The increment is used to increment the variable everytime an object is created. Since the class variable is has a public access modifier, we can directly call it through its variable name Car.total()

**If the class variable has a private access modifier, we need to create a getter method getTotal() to return the value of the total variable. We then call it through the getter name Car.getTotal()**

**Example 2: Using static to store the ID of an employee**

  ### Importing static methods
  We can import all static methods (static import on demand) or only certain static methods (single static import)

  **General syntax to import particular static method (single-type import)**
  
  import static packageName ClassName staticMethodName;

  **General syntax to import all static method (import on demand)**

  import static packageName ClassName.*;
  
  **Example:**
  
  The following code "import static java.lang.Math.* imports all the static method of the math class.

## this keyword
- Every object can access a reference to itself with keyword this
- When a non static method is called for a particular object, the method’s body implicitly uses keyword this to refer to the object’s instance variables and other methods.
- **As a result, it reduces the number of code duplication** whereby **the constructors with the this() keyword calls and passes the parameters to the complete constructor** 

**Syntax:**

this(arguments);

**Example 1: Using this keyword to simplify the code of method overload**

In the following code, the first three constructors with this() keyword will call and pass the parameters into the complete constructor. This makes the code simpler and minimises code duplication.

**Example 2: Using this keyword to diffentiate between instance variable and parameter when the instance variable and the parameter has the same name.**

the this keyword is also used explicitly to identify the difference between instance variable and parameter

this.brand = brand;

## final keyword
- final keyword is used to declare constant values. The constant variable name is usually declared with a final keyword at the front followed by the variable name in capital letters. The values of a constant variable cannot be changed once it has been initialized
- A final variable cannot be modified after it has been initialized. Thus, we cannot modify the value of the final variable by using the constant using setter. We can only set different constant values for different objects by initializing it in the constructor.

## Packages
- Packages are essentially folders which are used to group classes. Each class in the Java API belongs to a package that contains a group of related class
- The compiler uses a special object called a class loader to locate the class required
- If the package is not created, the java file is directly stored in the src folder. Once a package is declared, the java file is stored in sub folders of the src folder.

  ### Types of package
  1. Built in packages = packages from the Java API
  2. User-defined packages = custom packages which are created by the user
     
  ### Creating a package (user-defined packgage)
  - To declare a package, we need to provide the package name. The package name is the reverse order of the domain name.
  - Each . represents a sub folder
  
  **Example 1: domain name is deitel.com**
  
  package name: com.deitel
  
  extra package name: jhtp.ch08
  
  overall package name: com.deitel.jhtp.ch08

  **Example 2: java.util.Scanner**

  package name: java.util

  class name: Scanner

  overall package name: java.util.Scanner
  
  ### CLASSPATH
  - When compiling a class that uses classes from other packages, javac must locate the .class files for all
other classes being used. The compiler uses a special object called a class loader to locate the classes it needs.
  - **The class loader begins by searching the standard Java classes that are bundled with the JDK followed by optional packages.** **If the class is not found in the standard Java classes or in the extension classes, the class loader searches the classpath, which contains a list of locations in which classes are stored.**

    ### Setting temporary classpath using command prompt
    We can set custom classpath to store our packages through the command prompt. However, it is only temporary which means the classpath set will dissapear once the command prompt is closed.

    ### Setting permanent classpath in windows
    Under the windows search, type in system environment variables and select environment variables.

  ### Accessing packages
  To use java packages which are located in the same src folder, we need to import the package.

  However, if the package is located in another project, we need to add the package to Eclipse
  - Under eclipse, right click on the project, select properties followed by java build path. Click on the classpath and select class folder and choose the bin file of the project.
  - Once the packages are added, we can import the package and use it.

### Default access modifier
A variable or method which is declared without access modifier will have default access. It can be accessed by any class within the same package.
