# 02. Classes and Objects in depth

## Throw and catch exceptions
- Provides more flexibility for the class by throwing back an exception object to the caller.
- Use throw exceptions in the model class and use the try catch in the driver class to handle the exception throwed.

**Syntax:**

throw new IllegalArgumentException("custom message");

## Static class members
- Static is used when we need to share the same value across the whole object. This can be done by using the static keyword.
- Static can be applied to both variables and methods

### Applying static to variables/attributes/fields
- **instance variable** = each variable occupies different memory location for each object
- **class variable** = Variable which is declared with a static keyword. As a result, all variables of the objects of a class share the same value as they are stored at the same memory location

### Applying static to methods
- When we set the method to static, it is known as an class method. Instead of calling the method through the object, we call the method through its class name as the values are now applied to the class, not to specific objects.
- A class method can only manipulate class variable and call another static methods, it cannot maniupulate the instance variable. 

**In the following code, we have set the setColor() method to static. Hence, we need to call the method through the class name Car.setColor()** **An argumnent "green" has been provided Car.setColor("green") which will apply the argument "green" to all the objects.**

**Example 1: Using static to count the number of objects**

A public class variable name total is declared and inserted into the constructor. The increment is used to increment the variable everytime an object is created. Since the class variable is has a public access modifier, we can directly call it through its variable name Car.total()

**If the class variable has a private access modifier, we need to create a getter method getTotal() to return the value of the total variable. We then call it through the getter name Car.getTotal()**

**Example 2: Using static to store the ID of an employee**

  ### Importing static methods
  We can import all static methods (static import on demand) or only certain static methods (single static import)

  **General syntax to import particular static method**
  
  import static packageName ClassName staticMethodName;

  **General syntax to import all static method**

  import static packageName ClassName.*;
  
  **Example:**
  
  The following code "import static java.lang.Math.* imports all the static method of the math class.

## this keyword
**this() keyword is used to reduce the number of code duplication** whereby **the constructors with the this() keyword calls and passes the parameters to the complete constructor** 

**Syntax:**

this(arguments);

**Example 1: Using this keyword to simplify the code of method overload**

In the following code, the first three constructors with this() keyword will call and pass the parameters into the complete constructor. This makes the code simpler and minimises code duplication.

**Example 2: Using this keyword to diffentiate between instance variable and parameter when the instance variable and the parameter has the same name.**

the this keyword is also used explicitly to identify the difference between instance variable and parameter

this.brand = brand;

## final variables
- final variables are constant values. The variable name is usually in capital letters  .It cannot be changed once it has been initialized
- We cannot set the constant using setter. We can only set different constant values for different objects by declaring it in the constructor

## Packages
- Each class in the Java API belongs to a package that contains a group of related class
- The compiler uses a special object called a class loader to locate the class required

**package declaration**
package com.deitel.jhtp.ch08

### Using class from another java project 
- We can use the class from another java project bby adding libraries to eclipse
- Under eclipse, add class folder, choose bin

### Default access
A variable or method which is declared without access modifier will have default access. It can be accessed by any class within the same package.
