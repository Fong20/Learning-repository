# 02. Classes and Objects in depth

## Throw and catch exceptions
- Provides more flexibility for the caller to handle exceptions
- throw exceptions in the model class and use the try catch in the driver class to handle the exception throwed.

**Syntax:**

IllegalArgumentException("custom message");

## Static class members
The static is used when we need to share the same value across the whole object

**Important concept to understand**
- instance variable = each variable which occupies different memory location
- class variable = all variables of the objects of a class share the same memory location

Whenever the variable is declared with a static keyword, it becomes a class variable.

When we set the method to static, we use the class name followed by the method name as the values are applied to the class, not to specific objects
