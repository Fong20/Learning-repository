## Class
- **Class is known as the blueprint of a program**
- Class is represented by a noun
- The name of the class must be a general name and singular
- **A class can be reused to create many different objects with different value**
- It is possible to create a class within a class

  ### Types of class
  - Model class (represents information and behaviour in the appkication domain)
  - View Class (represents the interaction between the system
  - controlling class (performs coordination of objects and controlling of objects)


## Objects / Instance
- An object is refered to as an instance of the class. An object has attributes that it carries along as it's used in a program.
- Object is represented by an noun
- To use an object, we need to construct it. (new keyword)
- Eg: Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

## Attributes
- **Attributes are known as the properties/characteristics of the class**
- attributes are represented by adjectives
  
## Methods
- Methods are program statements which are required to perform a task in a program.
- It is stored under the class
- methods are represented by a verb

  ### Method calls
  To run a method, we need to send a message (method call) to tell a method of the object to perform its task.

## Object-oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
- OOAD is a process of Analyzing and designing your system from an object oriented point of view.
- Object-orientd programming allows us to implement object-oriented design as a working system

**Steps:**
1. Identify the class, attributes, object and method
2. Draw a UML class diagram
3. Convert it into code

## Unified Modeling Language
**The unified modeling language (UML) is the most widely used graphical scheme used for modeling object-oriented system.**

There are two UML diagrams which will be covered:
- Class diagram
- Class relationship diagram

### UML class diagram
Has 3 main sections
- class name
- attrbutes
- methods

The + and - sign represents the access modifier
- (+) corresponds to public access modifier
- (-) corresponds to private access modifier

There are three important things inside the method:
- constructor = has the same name as the class name but does not have the word class in it.
- setter/getter = setter sets the value for the constructor whereas the getter gets the value from the constructor
- other methods
