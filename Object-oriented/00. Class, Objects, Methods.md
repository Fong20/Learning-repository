# 00.Classes, Objects, Methods and Strings

**Rule of thumb**

## Class
- **Class is known as the blueprint of a program**
- Class is represented by a noun
- The name of the class must be a general name and singular
- **A class can be reused to create many different objects with different value**
- It is possible to create a class within a class

  ### Types of class
  - Model class (represents information and behaviour in the appkication domain)
  - View Class (represents the interaction between the system
  - controlling class (performs coordination of objects and controlling of objects)

## Objects / Instance
- An object is refered to as an instance of the class. An object has attributes that it carries along as it's used in a program. 
- Object is represented by an noun
- The object is also used to call a method that belongs to another class. To create an object of the class, we need to construct it. (new keyword)
- There can be a number of variables of the same name stored in different memory locations of the object.
- Eg: Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

  ### Instance
- Just as someone has to build a car from its engineering drawings before you can actually drive a car, w**e must build an
object of a class before a program can perform the tasks that the class’s methods define.**
- An object is then referred to as an instance of its class.
  
## Attributes
- **Attributes are known as the properties/characteristics of the class**
- attributes are represented by adjectives
  
## Methods
- Methods are program statements which are required to perform a task in a program.
- It is stored under the class
- methods are represented by a verb

  ### Main method
  Any class can contain a main method. However, the JVM only invokes the main method only in the class used to
execute the application.

  ### Method calls
  To run a method, we need to send a message (method call) to tell a method of the object to perform its task.

## Encapsulation
- The Classes encapsulate (i.e., wrap) attributes and methods into objects an object’s attributes and methods are intimately
related.
- The Objects may communicate with one another, but they’re normally not allowed to know how other objects are
implemented

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows classes to build upon classes. The newly created class inherits all properties and methods from its superclass (or parent class) and can also customize them and add its own unique features/characteristics.

## Object-oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
- OOAD is a process of Analyzing and designing your system from an object oriented point of view.
- Object-orientd programming allows us to implement object-oriented design as a working system

**Steps:**
1. Identify the class, attributes, object and method
2. Draw a UML class diagram
3. Convert it into code

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
**The unified modeling language (UML) is the most widely used graphical scheme used for modeling object-oriented system.**

There are two UML diagrams which will be covered:
- Class diagram
- Class relationship diagram

  ### UML class diagram
  Has 3 main sections
  - class name
  - attrbutes
  - methods
  
  The + and - sign represents the access modifier
  - (+) corresponds to public access modifier
  - (-) corresponds to private access modifier
  
  - model class = blueprint
  - driver class = It is a class which is used to test test the model class. It has a main method.
  
  **There are four important things inside the model class of the UML class diagram:**
  - **Constructor** = **Constructor is a unique method which has the same name as the class name** and **does not have a return type.** **The constructor is used to initialize the variables (object's attribute)** and **it will not return any values.** If we don't provide a constructor in a class, java will provide a default constructor with no parameters.
  - **setter (mutator)** = The setter (mutator) is used to set / modify the value of the object's attribute
  - **getter (accessor)** = The getter is used to retrieve the value of the objects's attribute
  - other methods
