It is possible to create a class within a class

attributes (adjective) = properties of the class

## Methods
- methods 
- methods are represented by a verb = what you can do in the class

To use an object, we need to construct it

## UML class diagram
Has 3 main sections

There are three important things inside the method
- constructor = has the same name as the class name but does not have the word class in it.

1. Identify the class, attributes, object and method
2. Draw a UML class diagram
3. Convert it into code
