# 03. UML Modelling and Class Relationship

Controller class = links all the model class together


## Associations
- Associations are defined as the connection/relationship between entities
- If two objects are linked, their classes are said to have an association

  Types of association
  1. Association
  2. Directed association
  3. Reflexive association

## Relationship between classes
To establish a relationship betwen classes, we need to create a variable in the class using the another class name.

## Aggregation (has a relationship)
- **composition is referred to as a weak has-a relationship** which means once the owning class is removed, the class which is linked will not be removed
- We do not need to create the object inside the owning class

**Example:**

Owning class: Library

The library has books

### Composition (has a relationship)
- **composition is referred to as a strong has-a relationship** which means once the owning class is removed, the class which is linked to it will also be removed
- The diamond is placed at the owning class
- In composition, we create the object inside the owning class
- To set the value, we need to get the value first then only set the value

**Example:**

Owning class: Library

The library has books

### Inheritance (is a relationship)
- Inaheritance does not have multiplictity

**Example:**

Parent class: fixed account

sub-class: bank account

A bank account is a fixed account
