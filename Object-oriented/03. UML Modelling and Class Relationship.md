# 03. UML Modelling and Class Relationship

Controller class = links all the model class together


## Associations
- Associations are defined as the connection/relationship between entities
- If two objects are linked, their classes are said to have an association

  Types of association
  1. Association
  2. Directed association
  3. Reflexive association

  **Association code**
  - In association, we do not need to put the class which we want to relate to in the attribute of the owning class.
  - It establishes a relationship between the class by accepting the parameter of the another class and using the using the parameter in the method.

  ### Reflexive association
  Reflexive association occurs when the class is mapped to itself (related to itself)

  Example: The employee object has multiple employees which are the boss and staffs

## Multiplictity
- Multiplicity specifies the range of cardinalities of an association
- It represents the business rules

  ### Multiplicity values

## Relationship between classes
To establish a relationship betwen classes, we need to create a variable in the class using the another class name.

## Aggregation (weak has a relationship)
- **composition is referred to as a weak has-a relationship** which means once the owning class is removed, the class which is linked will not be removed
- To establish an aggregation relationship, we need to create an attribute by using the object which we want to establish an aggregation relationship in the owning class.
- We do not need to use the new keyword to create the object inside the owning class

**Example:**

Owning class: Library

The library has books

### Composition (strong has a relationship)
- **composition is referred to as a strong has-a relationship** which means once the owning class is removed, the class which is linked to it will also be removed
- The diamond is placed at the owning class
-  To establish an composition relationship, we also need to create an attribute by using the object which we want to establish an aggregation relationship in the owning class.
- In composition, We need to use the new keyword to create the object inside the owning class, there is no need to declare the object inside the driver class
- To set the value, we need to use the getter to get the value first then followed by the setter to set the value

### Inheritance (is a relationship)
- Inaheritance does not have multiplictity

**Example:**

Parent class: fixed account

sub-class: bank account

A bank account is a fixed account
