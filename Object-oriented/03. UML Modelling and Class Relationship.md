# 03. UML Modelling and Class Relationship

Controller class = links all the model class together

## Multiplictity
- Multiplicity specifies the range of cardinalities of an association
- It represents the business rules

## Associations
- Associations are defined as the connection/relationship between objects of one class and the object of another class.
- If two objects are linked, their classes are said to have an association

  **Types of association**
  1. Aggregation (Weak has a relationship)
  2. Composition (Strong has a relationship)
  3. Uni-directional association (Directed association)
  4. Bi-directional association
  5. Reflexive association

   **Association code**
  - In association, we do not need to put the class which we want to relate to in the attribute of the owning class.
  - It establishes a relationship between the class by accepting the parameter of the another class and using the using the parameter in the method.

  ### Aggregation (weak has a relationship)
  - **aggregation is referred to as a weak has-a relationship** which means once the owning object is removed, the objects which are linked will not be removed
  - To establish an aggregation relationship, we need to create an attribute by using the object which we want to establish an aggregation relationship in the owning class.
  - In aggragation, We do not need to use the new keyword to create the object inside the owning class.

   ### UML Diagram of a aggregation relationship
  In an aggregation relationship, the UML diagram is represented by a diamond which is placed at the owning class.
  
  **Example:**
  
  The library has books
  
  The owning class is Library so the diamond needs to be placed at the library class

  ### Composition (strong has a relationship)
  - **composition is referred to as a strong has-a relationship** which means once the owning object is removed, the class which is linked to it will also be removed. This is because the linked object is created in the owning class.
  -  To establish an composition relationship, we also need to create an attribute by using the object which we want to establish an aggregation relationship in the owning class.
  - In composition, We need to use the new keyword to create the object inside the owning class, there is no need to declare the object inside the driver class
  - To set the value, we need to use the getter to get the value first then followed by the setter to set the value

  ### UML Diagram of a composition relationship
  In a composition relationship, the UML diagram is represented by a shaded diamond which is placed at the owning class.
  
  **Example:**
  
  The library has books
  
  The owning class is Library so the shaded diamond needs to be placed at the library class

  ### Reflexive association
  Reflexive association occurs when the class is mapped to itself (related to itself)

  Example: The employee object has multiple employees which are the boss and staffs

## Relationship between classes
To establish a relationship betwen classes, we need to create a variable in the class using the another class name.

## Inheritance (is a relationship)
- Inaheritance does not have multiplictity

**Example:**

Parent class: fixed account

sub-class: bank account

A bank account is a fixed account
