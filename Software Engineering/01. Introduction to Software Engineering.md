# 01. Introduction to Software Engineering

## Software
Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

### General Issues of Software

1. **Heterogeneity**
- Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. 

2. **Business and social change** 
- Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software. 

3. **Security and trust** 
- As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is essential that we can trust that software. 

4. **Scale**
- Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from very small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to Internet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community. 

## Software products
There are two types of software products which are generic and customized

### Generic products 
- Products which are marketed and sold to the general public. Eg: CAD software, MS Word etc
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the software developer and decisions on software change are made by the developer.

### Customized products 
- Products which are specifically made for a specific customer to meet their needs. Eg: ATC software, Traffic monitoring systems, embedded control systems etc.
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the customer and they make decisions on software changes that are required.

## Types of applications
1. Stand-alone application = application systems that run on a local computer, such as a PC. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to be connected to a network. 
2. Interactive transaction-based applications = Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. Eg: e-commerce applications. 
3. Embedded control systems = software control systems that control and manage hardware devices.
4. Batch-processing system = business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs. 
5. Entertainment systems = systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user. 
6. Modelling and simulation systems = systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations
7. Data collection systems = systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing. 
8. Systems of systems = systems that are composed of a number of other software systems. 

## Software costs
- Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost.
- Software typically costs more to maintain than it does to develop, especially systems with a long life where the maintenance costs may be several times development costs. Thus, software engineering is also concerned with cost-effective software development.

## Essential attributes of a good software
1. Maintainability = Able to evolve to satisfy the customer's /business changing needs
2. Dependability and security = Secure from malicious users
3. Efficiency = efficient usage of system resources to acheive a task
4. Acceptability = Understandable, usable for the users and compatible with other systems

## Software Engineering
- Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development. It is basically practiced to develop effective and efficient software that satisfies the user and customer's requirements. It encompasses all phases of the software development life cycle from the early stages of system specification / development through to maintainance of the system after it has gone into use.
  
- The life cycle includes requirement analysis and specification, design, construction, testing and operation and maintenance.

**Software development cycle**
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintenance

## Software process activities
1. Software specificiation = engineers define the nature and the constraint of the software
2. Software development = process where software is designed and programmed
3. Software validation = software is checked if it satisfies the customer's requirement
4. Software evolution = software can be modified to accomodate customer and market's changing requirements

## Types of software engineering
1. Traditional software engineering . Software engineering practices which are applied to the development of local software systems
2. Web-based software engineering. Software engineering practices which are applied to web-based applications

### Web-based software engineeering
- The Web is now a platform for running application and organizations are increasingly developing web-based systems rather than local systems.
- Web services allow application functionality to be accessed over the web.

**Key points of web-based software engineering**
1. **Software reuse**
- Software reuse is the dominant approach for constructing web-based systems. 	When building these systems, you think about how you can assemble them from pre-existing software components and systems.

2. **Incremental and agile development**
- Web-based systems should be developed and delivered incrementally. It is now generally recognized that it is impractical to specify all the requirements for such systems in advance. 

3. **Service-oriented systems**
- Software may be implemented using service-oriented software engineering, where the software components are stand-alone web services.  

4. **Rich interfaces** 
- Interface development technologies such as AJAX and HTML5 have emerged that support the creation of rich interfaces within a web browser.   

## Importance of software engineering
1. Produce more reliable and trustworthy software systems
2. More Cost efficient. As mentioned before, the software cost is generally higher than the hardware cost. Thus, software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development.

## Diversity in Software Engineering
- There are many different types of software system and there is no universal set of software techniques that is applicable to all of these.
- Thus, the software engineering methods and tools used depend on the type of application being developed, the requirements of the customer and the background of the development team.

## Software Engineering Fundamentals
1. Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development process. Of course, different processes are used for different types of software.
2. Dependability and performance are important for all types of system.
3. Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) are important.
4. Where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed rather than write new software.

## Ethical dillemas in Software Engineering
There are some ethical dillemas faced in software engineering such as below:
- Disagreement in principle with the policies of senior management which requires the software to be tweaked.
- Unauthorized release of the software. Eg: Your employer acts in an unethical way and releases a safety-critical system without finishing the testing of the system.
- Participation in the development of military weapons systems or nuclear systems.

Hardware architcture = Specifies the type of hardwares required and how it is implemented to work
