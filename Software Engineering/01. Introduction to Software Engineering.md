# 01. Introduction to Software Engineering 
- Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development.
- Software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development.
  
## Software products
- Generic products = Products which are marketed and sold to the general public
- Customized products = Products which are specifically made for a specific customer for their needs. Eg: ATC software, Traffic monitoring systems, embedded control systems etc.

## Essential attributes of a good software
1. Maintainability = Able to evolve to satisfy the customer's /business changing needs
2. Dependability and security = Secure from malicious users
3. Efficiency = efficient usage of system resources to acheive a task
4. Acceptability = Understandable, usable for the users and compatible with other systems

## Software process activities
1. Software specificiation = engineers define the constraint of the software
2. Software development = process where software is designed and programmed
3. Software validation = software is checked if it satisfies the customer's requirement
4. Software evolution = software can be modified to accomodate customer and market's changing requirements

## Types of applications
1. Stand-alone application
2. Interactive transaction-based applications
3. Embedded control systems
4. Batch-processing system
5. Entertainment systems
6. Modelling and simulation systems
7. Data collection systems
8. Systems of systems
