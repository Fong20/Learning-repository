# 08. Software Evolution

## Software Change
Software change is inevitable
- New requirements emerge when the software is used;
- The business environment changes;
- Errors must be repaired;
- New computers and equipment is added to the system;
- The performance or reliability of the system may have to be improved.

## Importance of evolution
- Organisations have huge investments in their software systems - they are critical business assets.
- To maintain the value of these assets to the business, they must be changed and updated.
- The majority of the software budget in large companies is devoted to changing and evolving existing software rather than developing new software.

## Evolution and servicing

### Evolution
The stage in a software system’s life cycle where it is in operational use and is evolving as new requirements are proposed and implemented in the system.

### Servicing
At this stage, the software remains useful but the only changes made are those required to keep it operational i.e. bug fixes and changes to reflect changes in the software’s environment. No new functionality is added.

### Phase-out
The software may still be used but no further changes are made to it.

## Evolution processes
The process of software evolution is driven by requests for changes and includes change impact analysis, release planning and change implementation.

### Change implementation
- Iteration of the development process where the revisions to the system are designed, implemented and tested.
- A critical difference is that the first stage of change implementation may involve program understanding, especially if the original system developers are not responsible for  the change implementation.
- During the program understanding phase, you have to understand how the program is structured, how it delivers functionality and how the proposed change might affect the program.

### Urgent change requests
- Urgent changes may have to be implemented without going through all stages of the software engineering process
- If a serious system fault has to be repaired to allow normal operation to continue;
- If changes to the system’s environment (e.g. an OS upgrade) have unexpected effects;
- If there are business changes that require a very rapid response (e.g. the release of a competing product).

## Legacy systems
- Legacy systems are older systems that rely on languages and technology that are no longer used for new systems development.
- Legacy software may be dependent on older hardware, such as mainframe computers and may have associated legacy processes and procedures.
- Legacy systems are not just software systems but are broader socio-technical systems that include hardware, software, libraries and other supporting software and business processes. 

### Legacy system replacement
Legacy system replacement is risky and expensive so businesses continue to use these systems

System replacement is risky for a number of reasons
- Lack of complete system specification
- Tight integration of system and business processes
- Undocumented business rules embedded in the legacy system
- New software development may be late and/or over budget

### Legacy system change
Legacy systems are expensive to change for a number of reasons:
- No consistent programming style
- Use of obsolete programming languages with few people available with these language skills
- Inadequate system documentation
- System structure degradation
- Program optimizations may make them hard to understand
- Data errors, duplication and inconsistency

### Legacy system management
Organisations that rely on legacy systems must choose a strategy for evolving these systems whic could be:
- Scrap the system completely and modify business processes so that it is no longer required;
- Continue maintaining the system;
- Transform the system by re-engineering to improve its maintainability;
- Replace the system with a new system.
  
The strategy chosen should depend on the system quality and its business value.

### Legacy system assessment
Assessment is performed by analyzing the business value and system quality

#### Business value assessment
Assessment should take different viewpoints into account
- System end-users;
- Business customers;
- Line managers;
- IT managers;
- Senior managers.

Interview different stakeholders and collate results.

#### System quality assessment
1. Business process assessment
- How well does the business process support the current goals of the business?

2. Environment assessment
- How effective is the system’s environment and how expensive is it to maintain?

3. Application assessment
- What is the quality of the application software system?


#### Types of asessment
1. Low quality, low business value
- These systems should be scrapped. 

2. Low-quality, high-business value
- These make an important business contribution but are expensive to maintain. Should be re-engineered or replaced if a suitable system is available.

3. High-quality, low-business value
- Replace with COTS, scrap completely or maintain.

4. High-quality, high business value
- Continue in operation using normal system maintenance.

## Software Maintenance
- Describe as the process of Modifying a program after it has been put into use.
- The term is mostly used for changing custom software. Generic software products are said to evolve to create new versions.
- Maintenance does not normally involve major changes to the system’s architecture.
- Changes are implemented by modifying existing components and adding new components to the system.

### Types of maintenance
1. Fault repairs
- Changing a system to fix bugs/vulnerabilities and correct deficiencies in the way meets its requirements.

2. Environmental adaptation
- Maintenance to adapt software to a different operating environment
- Changing a system so that it operates in a different environment (computer, OS, etc.) from its initial implementation.

3. Functionality addition and modification 
- Modifying the system to satisfy new requirements.

### Maintenance Costs
- Usually greater than development costs (2* to 100* depending on the application).
- Affected by both technical and non-technical factors.
- Increases as software is maintained. Maintenance corrupts the software structure so makes further maintenance more difficult.
- Ageing software can have high support costs (e.g. old languages, compilers etc.).

It is usually more expensive to add new features to a system during maintenance than it is to add the same features during development. This is because:
- A new team has to understand the programs being maintained
- Separating maintenance and development means there is no incentive for the development team to write maintainable software
- Program maintenance work is unpopular
- Maintenance staff are often inexperienced and have limited domain knowledge.
- As programs age, their structure degrades and they become harder to change.

### Maintenance prediction
Maintenance prediction is concerned with assessing which parts of the system may cause problems and have high maintenance costs

- Change acceptance depends on the maintainability of the components affected by the change;
- Implementing changes degrades the system and reduces its maintainability;
- Maintenance costs depend on the number of changes and costs of change depend on maintainability.

### Change prediction
- Predicting the number of changes requires and understanding of the relationships between a system and its environment.
- Tightly coupled systems require changes whenever the environment is changed.

#### Factors influencing this relationship
- Number and complexity of system interfaces;
- Number of inherently volatile system requirements;
- The business processes where the system is used.

### Complexity metrics
- Predictions of maintainability can be made by assessing the complexity of system components.
- Studies have shown that most maintenance effort is spent on a relatively small number of system components.

Complexity depends on
- Complexity of control structures;
- Complexity of data structures;
- Object, method (procedure) and module size.

### Process metrics
Process metrics may be used to assess maintainability

**Examples:**
- Number of requests for corrective maintenance;
- Average time required for impact analysis;
- Average time taken to implement a change request;
- Number of outstanding change requests.

If any or all of these is increasing, this may indicate a decline in maintainability.

## Software Reengineering
- Restructuring or rewriting part or all of a legacy system without changing its functionality.
- Applicable where some but not all sub-systems of a larger system require frequent maintenance.
- Reengineering involves adding effort to make them easier to maintain. The system may be re-structured and re-documented.

### Advantages of Software Reengineering
1. Reduced risk
- There is a high risk in new software development. There may be development problems, staffing problems and specification problems.

2. Reduced cost
- The cost of re-engineering is often significantly less than the costs of developing new software.

### Software reengineering process
1. Source code translation
- Convert code to a new language.

2. Reverse engineering
- Analyse the program to understand it;

3. Program structure improvement
- Restructure automatically for understandability;

4. Program modularisation
- Reorganise the program structure;

5. Data reengineering
- Clean-up and restructure system data.

## Refactoring
- Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degradation through change.
- You can think of refactoring as ‘preventative maintenance’ that reduces the problems of future change.
- Refactoring involves modifying a program to improve its structure, reduce its complexity or make it easier to understand.
- When you refactor a program, you should not add functionality but rather concentrate on program improvement. 

## Refactoring vs Reengineering
- Re-engineering takes place after a system has been maintained for some time and maintenance costs are increasing. You use automated tools to process and re-engineer a legacy system to create a new system that is more maintainable. 
- Refactoring is a continuous process of improvement throughout the development and evolution process. It is intended to avoid the structure and code degradation that increases the costs and difficulties of maintaining a system.
