# 08. Software Evolution

## Software Change
Software change is inevitable
- New requirements emerge when the software is used;
- The business environment changes;
- Errors must be repaired;
- New computers and equipment is added to the system;
- The performance or reliability of the system may have to be improved.

## Importance of evolution
- Organisations have huge investments in their software systems - they are critical business assets.
- To maintain the value of these assets to the business, they must be changed and updated.
- The majority of the software budget in large companies is devoted to changing and evolving existing software rather than developing new software.

## Evolution and servicing

### Evolution
The stage in a software system’s life cycle where it is in operational use and is evolving as new requirements are proposed and implemented in the system.

### Servicing
At this stage, the software remains useful but the only changes made are those required to keep it operational i.e. bug fixes and changes to reflect changes in the software’s environment. No new functionality is added.

### Phase-out
The software may still be used but no further changes are made to it.

### Change implementation
- Iteration of the development process where the revisions to the system are designed, implemented and tested.
- A critical difference is that the first stage of change implementation may involve program understanding, especially if the original system developers are not responsible for  the change implementation.
- During the program understanding phase, you have to understand how the program is structured, how it delivers functionality and how the proposed change might affect the program.

### Urgent change requests
- Urgent changes may have to be implemented without going through all stages of the software engineering process
- If a serious system fault has to be repaired to allow normal operation to continue;
- If changes to the system’s environment (e.g. an OS upgrade) have unexpected effects;
- If there are business changes that require a very rapid response (e.g. the release of a competing product).

## Legacy systems
- Legacy systems are older systems that rely on languages and technology that are no longer used for new systems development.
- Legacy software may be dependent on older hardware, such as mainframe computers and may have associated legacy processes and procedures.
- Legacy systems are not just software systems but are broader socio-technical systems that include hardware, software, libraries and other supporting software and business processes. 

### Legacy system replacement
Legacy system replacement is risky and expensive so businesses continue to use these systems

System replacement is risky for a number of reasons
- Lack of complete system specification
- Tight integration of system and business processes
- Undocumented business rules embedded in the legacy system
- New software development may be late and/or over budget

### Legacy system change
Legacy systems are expensive to change for a number of reasons:
- No consistent programming style
- Use of obsolete programming languages with few people available with these language skills
- Inadequate system documentation
- System structure degradation
- Program optimizations may make them hard to understand
- Data errors, duplication and inconsistency

### Legacy system management
Organisations that rely on legacy systems must choose a strategy for evolving these systems whic could be:
- Scrap the system completely and modify business processes so that it is no longer required;
- Continue maintaining the system;
- Transform the system by re-engineering to improve its maintainability;
- Replace the system with a new system.
  
The strategy chosen should depend on the system quality and its business value.

### Legacy system assessment
Assessment is performed by analyzing the business value and system quality

#### Business value assessment
Assessment should take different viewpoints into account
- System end-users;
- Business customers;
- Line managers;
- IT managers;
- Senior managers.

Interview different stakeholders and collate results.

#### System quality assessment
1. Business process assessment
- How well does the business process support the current goals of the business?

2. Environment assessment
- How effective is the system’s environment and how expensive is it to maintain?

3. Application assessment
- What is the quality of the application software system?


#### Types of asessment
1. Low quality, low business value
- These systems should be scrapped. 

2. Low-quality, high-business value
- These make an important business contribution but are expensive to maintain. Should be re-engineered or replaced if a suitable system is available.

3. High-quality, low-business value
- Replace with COTS, scrap completely or maintain.

4. High-quality, high business value
- Continue in operation using normal system maintenance.
