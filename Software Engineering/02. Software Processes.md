# 02. Software Processes
Defined as a structured set of activities required to develop a software system. 

## Key aspects of software processes
- Specification – defining what the system should do;
- Design and implementation – defining the organization of the system and implementing the system;
- Validation – checking that it does what the customer wants;
- Evolution – changing the system in response to changing customer needs.

## Process descriptions
- outcome of a process
- roles. Who is involved in the process


## Plan-driven vs Agile Process
- Plan-driven process = process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
- Agile process planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 

## Software process models
1. Waterfall model (Plan-driven process)
2. Incremental development model (Plan-driven / Agile process)
3. Integration and configuration model

In practice, most large systems are developed using a process that incorporates elements from all of these models.


### Waterfall model
Normally used when the requirements are well-understood and there are limited changes during the design process

Drawbacks of waterfall model
- Rigid and not flexible. Any updates will need to be restarted from the initial phase
- Time-consuming. As any updates made will need to be restarted from the initial phase which is also time consuming

### Incremental development model
- Rather than deliver the system as a single delivery, the development and delivery is broken down into increments with each increment delivering part of the required functionality.
- User requirements are prioritised and the highest priority requirements are included in early increments
- Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen though requirements for later increments can continue to evolve.

- Develop the system in increments and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the next increment;
- Normal approach used in agile methods;
- Evaluation done by user/customer proxy.

Intermediate versions = beta version
Final version = Stable version

### Integration and configuration model (reuse and configure)
- Based on software reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or application systems
- Reused elements may be configured to adapt their behaviour and functionality to a user’s requirements

## Software Prototyping
A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options.

A prototype can be used in:
- The requirements engineering process to help with requirements elicitation and validation;
- In design processes to explore options and develop a UI design;
- In the testing process to run back-to-back tests.

### Benefits of prototyping
- Improved system usability.
- A closer match to users’ real needs.
- Improved design quality.
- Improved maintainability.
- Reduced development effort.
