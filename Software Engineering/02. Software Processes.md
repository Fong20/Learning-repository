# 02. Software Processes
Software Process is defined as a structured set of activities required to develop a software system. 

## Key aspects of software processes
- Software Specification – Defining the function of the software and its limitations
- Software Design and implementation – defining the organization of the system and implementing the system;
- Software Validation – Checking if the software meets the customer requirements
- Software Evolution – Ensure that the software is written in a way which is adaptable to changing customer needs.

## Software process descriptions
- Software process descriptions are defined as the activities performed in each of the process
- Eg: specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc. and the ordering of these activities.

Software process descriptions could also include:
- Products. Outcome of a process activity
- Roles. Who is involved in the process and what are their responsibilities?
- Pre-post conditions. Statements that are true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced.  

## Plan-driven vs Agile Process
Before we dive into the types of software process models, we need to identify the difference between plan-driven process and agile process.

### Plan-driven
- Plan-driven process is a process where process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
- It is always planned, and the results are shown at the end of the product.

### Agile
- Agile process planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
- It is basically a process-based method where one can alter the way things and planning and replace them with the more suitable ones.

In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches. Hence, there are no right or wrong software processes.

## Software process models
A software process model is an **abstract representation** of a process. These models serve as blueprints that guide developers, designers, and stakeholders through the system’s structure, behavior, and functionality.

**Types of software process models**
1. Waterfall model
2. Incremental development model 
3. Integration and configuration model

In practice, most large systems are developed using a process that incorporates elements from all of these models.

### Waterfall model
- Normally used when the requirements are well-understood and there are limited changes during the design process
- It is a plan-driven model

**Phases in waterfall model:**
- Requirements analysis and definition = Requirements of the system are collected and documented. 
- System and software design = Defines how the software will be built. Eg: Prepare the blueprint of the software system so that no problems are faced in the coming phases and solutions to all the requirements in the requirement phase are found.
- Implementation and unit testing = The development of software is carried out. Eg: Coding, debugging, implementing database etc
- Integration and system testing = The software is verified and evaluated through various testing phases to ensure that we have created the right product.
- Operation and maintenance = Process of taking care of the finished software and maintaining it as per time once it is utilized by the users

**Drawbacks of waterfall model**
- Rigid and not flexible. It is the difficult to accommodate change after the process is underway. Any updates will need to be restarted from the initial phase
- Time-consuming. As any updates made will need to be restarted from the initial phase, it is also time consuming

### Incremental development model
- Rather than deliver the system as a single delivery, the development and delivery is broken down into increments with each increment delivering part of the required functionality.
- User requirements are prioritised and the highest priority requirements are included in early increments
- Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen though requirements for later increments can continue to evolve.
- It may be a plan-driven model or agile model

- Develop the system in increments and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the next increment;
- Normal approach used in agile methods;
- Evaluation done by user/customer proxy.

Intermediate versions = beta version
Final version = Stable version

### Integration and configuration model (reuse and configure)
- Based on software reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or application systems
- Reused elements may be configured to adapt their behaviour and functionality to a user’s requirements
- It may be a plan-driven model or agile model

## Software Prototyping
A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options.

A prototype can be used in:
- The requirements engineering process to help with requirements elicitation and validation;
- In design processes to explore options and develop a UI design;
- In the testing process to run back-to-back tests.

### Benefits of prototyping
- Improved system usability.
- A closer match to users’ real needs.
- Improved design quality.
- Improved maintainability.
- Reduced development effort.
