# 05. Architectural Design
- The software needs an architectural design to represent the design of the software. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.
- Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.
- Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them.
- The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. 

## Benefits of architectural design
1. Stakeholder communication
- Architecture may be used as a focus of discussion by system stakeholders.
  
2. System analysis
- Means that analysis of whether the system can meet its non-functional requirements is possible.

3. Large-scale reuse
- The architecture may be reusable across a range of systems
- Product-line architectures may be developed.

## Architectural patterns
- Patterns are a means of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge.
- An architectural pattern is a stylized description of good design practice, which has been tried and tested in different environments.
- Patterns should include information about when they are and when the are not useful.
- Patterns may be represented using tabular and graphical descriptions.

## Types of architectural patterns
1. Model-View-Controller Pattern (MVC)
2. Layered architecture
3. Repository architecture
4. Client-server architecture
5. Pipe and filter architecture

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
In MVC, the interaction and presentation is separated from the system data. The system is divided into three components which are controller, model and view

1. The Controller component manages user interaction (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, etc.) and passes these interactions to the View and the Model.
2. Model component manages the system data and associated operations on that data.
3. The View component defines and manages how the data is presented to the user.

### Layered architecture (N-tier architecture)
- Organises the system into a set of layers (or abstract machines) each of which provide a set of services.
- Each layer has unique tasks to do and all the layers are independent of one another.
- Supports the incremental development of sub-systems in different layers. Since each layer is independent, one can modify the code inside a layer without affecting others. It is the most commonly used pattern for designing the majority of software.

#### Layers in layered architecture
1. Presentation layer: The user interface layer where we see and enter data into an application.)
2. Business layer: This layer is responsible for executing business logic as per the request.)
3. Application layer: This layer acts as a medium for communication between the ‘presentation layer’ and ‘data layer’.
4. Data layer: This layer has a database for managing data.)

## Repositary architecture
- Shared data is held in a central database or repository and may be accessed by all sub-systems;
- Each sub-system maintains its own database and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.

## Client-server architecture
- Distributed system model which shows how data and processing is distributed across a range of components. Can be implemented on a single computer.
- Set of stand-alone servers which provide specific services such as printing, data management, etc.
- Set of clients which call on these services.
- Network which allows clients to access servers.

## Pipe and filter architecture
