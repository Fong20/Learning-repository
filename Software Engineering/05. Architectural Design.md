# 05. Architectural Design
- The software needs an architectural design to represent the design of the software. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.
- Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.
- Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them.
- The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. 

## Benefits of architectural design
1. Stakeholder communication
- Architecture may be used as a focus of discussion by system stakeholders.
  
2. System analysis
- Means that analysis of whether the system can meet its non-functional requirements is possible.

3. Large-scale reuse
- The architecture may be reusable across a range of systems
- Product-line architectures may be developed.

## Architectural patterns
- Patterns are a means of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge.
- An architectural pattern is a stylized description of good design practice, which has been tried and tested in different environments.
- Patterns should include information about when they are and when the are not useful.
- Patterns may be represented using tabular and graphical descriptions.

## Types of architectural patterns
1. Model-View-Controller Pattern (MVC)
2. Layered architecture
3. Repository architecture
4. Client-server architecture
5. Pipe and filter architecture

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
In MVC, the interaction and presentation is separated from the system data. The system is divided into three components which are controller, model and view

1. The Controller component manages user interaction (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, etc.) and passes these interactions to the View and the Model.
2. Model component manages the system data and associated operations on that data.
3. The View component defines and manages how the data is presented to the user.

### Layered architecture (N-tier architecture)
- Organises the system into a set of layers (or abstract machines) each of which provide a set of services.
- Each layer has unique tasks to do and all the layers are independent of one another.
- Supports the incremental development of sub-systems in different layers. Since each layer is independent, one can modify the code inside a layer without affecting others. It is the most commonly used pattern for designing the majority of software.

#### Layers in layered architecture
1. Presentation layer: The user interface layer where we see and enter data into an application.)
2. Business layer: This layer is responsible for executing business logic as per the request.)
3. Application layer: This layer acts as a medium for communication between the ‘presentation layer’ and ‘data layer’.
4. Data layer: This layer has a database for managing data.)

**Example: Layered architecture used for electronic learning system (iLearn)**

#### Advantages
1. Scalability: Individual layers in the architecture can be scaled independently to meet performance needs.
2. Flexibility: Different technologies can be used within each layer without affecting others.
3. Maintainability: Changes in one layer do not necessarily impact other layers, thus simplifying the maintenance.

#### Disadvantages
1. Complexity: Adding more layers to the architecture can make the system more complex and difficult to manage.
2. Performance Overhead: Multiple layers can introduce latency due to additional communication between the layers.
3. Strict Layer Separation: Strict layer separation can sometimes lead to inefficiencies and increased development effort.

## Repositary architecture
- In repository architecture, all the system's data is held in a central database or repository which are accessed by all sub-systems/system components
- Each sub-system maintains its own database and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.
- When large amounts of data are to be shared, the repository model of sharing is most commonly used a this is an efficient data sharing mechanism.

**Example: Repository architecture of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/601c9009-244f-4589-930d-1c9426912dc5)

#### Advantages
Components can be independent—they do not need to know of the existence of other components. Changes made by one component can be propagated to all components. All data can be managed consistently (e.g., backups done at the same time) as it is all in one place. 

#### Disadvantages
The repository is a single point of failure so problems in the repository affect the whole system

## Client-server architecture
The client-server pattern has two major entities. They are a server and multiple clients. Here the server has resources(data, files or services) and a client requests the server for a particular resource. Then the server processes the request and responds back accordingly.

**Example: Film Library**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1c5d9b-39e5-45c0-9ab6-b236f1ca6bb6)

#### Advantages:
1. Centralized Management: Servers can centrally manage resources, data, and security policies, thus simplifying the maintenance.
2. Scalability: Servers can be scaled up to handle increased client requests.
3. Security: Security measures such as access controls, data encryption can be implemented in a better way due to centralized controls.

#### Disadvantages:
1. Single Point of Failure: Due to centralized server, if server fails clients lose access to services, leading loss of productivity.
2. Costly: Setting up and maintaining servers can be expensive due to hardware, software, and administrative costs.
3. Complexity: Designing and managing a client-server architecture can be complex.

## Pipe and filter architecture
Pipe-Filter Architecture Pattern structures a system around a series of processing elements called filters that are connected by pipes. Each filter processes data and passes it to the next filter via pipe.

#### Advantages
1. Reusability: Filters can be reused in different pipelines or applications.
2. Scalability: Additional filters can be added to extend the functionality to the pipeline.
3. Parallelism: Filters can be executed in parallel if they are stateless, thus improving performance.

#### Disadvantages
1. Debugging Difficulty: Identifying and debugging issues are difficult in long pipelines.
2. Data Format constraints: Filters must agree on the data format, requiring careful design and standardization.
3. Latency: Data must be passed through multiple filters, which can introduce latency.

## Application architectures
- Software Architecture defines fundamental organization of a system and more simply defines a structured solution. It defines how components of a software system are assembled, their relationship and communication between them. It serves as a blueprint for software application and development basis for developer team.

Software architecture defines a list of things which results in making many things easier in the software development process.

### Uses of application architectures
- As a starting point for architectural design.
- As a design checklist.
- As a way of organising the work of the development team.
- As a means of assessing components for reuse.
- As a vocabulary for talking about application types.

### Types of application
1. Data processing applications
Data driven applications that process data in batches without explicit user intervention during the processing.

2. Transaction processing applications
- Data-centred applications that process user requests and update information in a system database.
- Eg: E-commerce systems, reservation systems

3. Event processing systems
Applications where system actions depend on interpreting events from the system’s environment.

4. Language processing systems
- Applications where the users’ intentions are specified in a formal language that is processed and interpreted by the system.
- Eg: Compilers, command interpreters
