# 05. Architectural Design
- Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.
- Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them.
- The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. 

## Architectural pattern
- Patterns are a means of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge.
- An architectural pattern is a stylized description of good design practice, which has been tried and tested in different environments.
- Patterns should include information about when they are and when the are not useful.
- Patterns may be represented using tabular and graphical descriptions.

## Layered architecture

## Repositary architecture
- Shared data is held in a central database or repository and may be accessed by all sub-systems;
- Each sub-system maintains its own database and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.

## Client-server architecture
- Distributed system model which shows how data and processing is distributed across a range of components. Can be implemented on a single computer.
- Set of stand-alone servers which provide specific services such as printing, data management, etc.
- Set of clients which call on these services.
- Network which allows clients to access servers.

## Pipe and filter architecture
