# 05. Architectural Design
- Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.
- Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them.
- The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. 

## Architectural pattern
- Patterns are a means of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge.
- An architectural pattern is a stylized description of good design practice, which has been tried and tested in different environments.
- Patterns should include information about when they are and when the are not useful.
- Patterns may be represented using tabular and graphical descriptions.
