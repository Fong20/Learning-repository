# 04. Requirements Engineering

## Requirement
Requirements = customer's needs

### Types of requirement
1. User requirement = Written for customers
2. System requirement = structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints.

### Relationship between requirement and design
- In principle, requirements should state what the system should do and the design should describe how it does this.
- In practice, requirements and design are inseparable.
- A system architecture may be designed to structure the requirements;
- The system may inter-operate with other systems that generate design requirements;
- The use of a specific architecture to satisfy non-functional requirements may be a domain requirement.
- This may be the consequence of a regulatory requirement.

### Guideline to write requirements
- Invent a standard format and use it for all requirements.
- Use language in a consistent way. Use shall for mandatory requirements, should for desirable requirements.
- Use text highlighting to identify key parts of the requirement.
- Avoid the use of computer jargon.
- Include an explanation (rationale) of why a requirement is necessary.
  
## Requirement Engineering
The process of establishing the services that a customer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed.

### Requirement engineering process
There are four processes:
1. Requirements elicitation
2. Requirements specification
3. Requirements validation

**Spiral view of requirements engineering**

business requirements specification = the requirements required for the system in the business perspective
feasibility = is it doable
elicitation = how the user acheive the functionality of the service
user requirements specification = the requirements required for the system in the user perspective
system requirement elicitation =
system requirements specification and modeling =

#### Requirement elicitation
- Sometimes called requirements elicitation or requirements discovery.
- Involves technical staff working with customers to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide and the system’s operational constraints.
- Software engineers work with a range of system stakeholders to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide, the required system performance, hardware constraints, other systems, etc.
- May involve end-users, managers, engineers involved in maintenance, domain experts, trade unions, etc. These are called stakeholders.

**Requirement elicitation Stages:**
1. Requirements discovery = Interacting with stakeholders to discover their requirements. Domain requirements are also discovered at this stage.
2. Requirements classification and organization = Groups related requirements and organises them into coherent clusters.
3. Requirements prioritization and negotiation = Prioritising requirements and resolving requirements conflicts.
4. Requirements specification = The process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document.

Requirement elicitation methods
1. Interviewing
2. Ethnography
   
**Problems of requirement eliciation**
- Stakeholders don’t know what they really want.
- Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms.
- Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements.
- Organisational and political factors may influence the system requirements.
- The requirements change during the analysis process. New stakeholders may emerge and the business environment may change.


#### Requirement specification

#### Requirement validation
- Concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customer really wants.
- Requirements error costs are high so validation is very important Fixing a requirements error after delivery may cost up to 100 times the cost of fixing an implementation error.

**Criterias to be checked (Requirements checking)**
1. Validity. Does the system provide the functions which best support the customer’s needs?
2. Consistency. Are there any requirements conflicts?
3. Completeness. Are all functions required by the customer included?
4. Realism. Can the requirements be implemented given available budget and technology
5. Verifiability. Can the requirements be checked?

Requirement validation techniques
1. Requirements reviews. Systematic manual analysis of the requirements.
2. Prototyping Using an executable model of the system to check requirements. Covered in Chapter 2.
3. Test-case generation. Developing tests for requirements to check testability.



## System requirements
- system requirements are the descriptions of the system services and constraints that are generated during the requirements engineering process.
- System requirements are more detailed requirements and may include more technical information.

## System stakeholders
Any person or organization who is affected by the system in some way and so who has a legitimate interest

Types of stakeholders
- End users
- System managers
- System owners
- External stakeholders

## Functional and non-functional requirements

### Functional requirements
- Statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations.
- May state what the system should not do.
  
### Non-functional requirements
- Functional system requirements should describe the system services in detail.
- Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
- Often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.

**Types of non-functional classifications:**
1. Product requirements
- Requirements which specify that the delivered product must behave in a particular way e.g. execution speed, reliability, etc.

Examples:
- efficiency (performance and space requirements)
- dependability
- security
- usability

#### Usability requirements
How easy are the users able to use the system

2. Organisational requirements
- Requirements which are a consequence of organisational policies and procedures e.g. process standards used, implementation requirements, etc.

3. External requirements
- Requirements which arise from factors which are external to the system and its development process e.g. interoperability requirements, legislative requirements, etc.

Example
- regulatory
- ethical

Importance of non-functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of a system rather than the individual components.  For example, to ensure that performance requirements are met, you may have to organize the system to minimize communications between components.
- A single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate a number of related functional requirements that define system services that are required. It may also generate requirements that restrict existing requirements. 

## Requirements imprecision
Defined as the problem which occur when functional requirements are not precisely stated.

## Requirement completeness and consistency
In principle, requirements should be both complete and consistent.

### Complete
They should include descriptions of all facilities required.

### Consistency
There should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system facilities.

In practice, because of system and environmental complexity, it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document.
