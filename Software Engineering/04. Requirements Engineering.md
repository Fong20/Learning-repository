# 04. Requirements Engineering

## Requirement
According to IEEE standard 729, a requirement is defined as follows:

- A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
- A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents

Essentially, requirements = fulfillment of customer's needs

### Types of requirement
1. User requirement = Written for customers
2. System requirement = structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints. 

#### User requirement
User requirement define the software results and qualties expected from the users and is expressed in natural language

#### System requirement
- System requirement define how the system is built to meet the user's needs
- It details technical aspects like architecture, hardware, and interfaces to achieve the desired functionalities.

## Functional and non-functional requirements

### Functional requirements
- Functional requirements describe what the software should do. They define the functions or features that the system must have. These are the basic features and functionalities that users expect from the software.
- May state what the system should not do.
  
### Non-functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements describe how the software performs a task rather than what it should do. 
-  Non-functional requirements are about the system’s behavior, quality, and constraints. They define the quality attributes, performance criteria, and constraints. Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
- Often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.

#### Types of non-functional classifications:
1. Product requirements
2. Organizational requirements
3. External requirements
   
**Product requirements**
- Requirements which specify that the delivered product must behave in a particular way e.g. execution speed, reliability, etc.

**Examples:**
- efficiency (performance and space requirements)
- dependability
- security
- usability (How easy are the users able to use the system)

**Organisational requirements**
- Requirements which are a consequence of organisational policies and procedures e.g. process standards used, implementation requirements, etc.

**External requirements**
- Requirements which arise from factors which are external to the system and its development process e.g. interoperability requirements, legislative requirements, etc.

**Example**
- regulatory
- ethical
- legistative

**Importance of non-functional requirements**
- Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of a system rather than the individual components.  For example, to ensure that performance requirements are met, you may have to organize the system to minimize communications between components.
- A single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate a number of related functional requirements that define system services that are required. It may also generate requirements that restrict existing requirements. 

## Requirements imprecision
Defined as the problem which occur when functional requirements are not precisely stated.

## Requirement completeness and consistency
- In principle, requirements should be both complete and consistent.
- However, it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document because of system and environmental complexity.

**Complete**
Requirements should include descriptions of all facilities required.

**Consistent**
There should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system facilities.

## Requirement Engineering
The process of establishing the services that a customer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed.

### Requirement engineering process
The processes used for RE vary widely depending on the application domain, the people involved and the organisation developing the requirements.

However, There are four geenral RE processes:
1. Requirements elicitation
2. Requirements specification
3. Requirements validation
4. Requirements management

**Spiral view of requirements engineering**

business requirements specification = the requirements required for the system in the business perspective

feasibility = is it doable

elicitation = how the user acheive the functionality of the service

user requirements specification = the requirements required for the system in the user perspective

#### Requirement elicitation
- Sometimes called requirements elicitation or requirements discovery.
- Involves technical staff working with customers to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide and the system’s operational constraints.
- Software engineers work with a range of system stakeholders to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide, the required system performance, hardware constraints, other systems, etc.
- May involve end-users, managers, engineers involved in maintenance, domain experts, trade unions, etc. These are called stakeholders.

**Requirement elicitation Stages:**
1. Requirements discovery = Interacting with stakeholders to discover their requirements. Domain requirements are also discovered at this stage.
2. Requirements classification and organization = Groups related requirements and organises them into coherent clusters.
3. Requirements prioritization and negotiation = Prioritising requirements and resolving requirements conflicts.
4. Requirements specification = The process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document.

**Requirement elicitation methods**
1. Interviewing (closed / open interviews)
2. Ethnography (derived from cooperation and awareness of other people’s activities.)

**Problems of requirement eliciation**
- Stakeholders don’t know what they really want.
- Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms.
- Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements.
- Organisational and political factors may influence the system requirements.
- The requirements change during the analysis process. New stakeholders may emerge and the business environment may change.

#### Requirement specification
- Requirements specification is the process of formally documenting the user and system requirements and creating a software requirements document.
- The software requirements document is an agreed statement of the system requirements. It should be organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it.

#### Relationship between requirement and design
- In principle, requirements should state what the system should do and the design should describe how it does this.
- In practice, requirements and design are inseparable.
- A system architecture may be designed to structure the requirements;
- The system may inter-operate with other systems that generate design requirements;
- The use of a specific architecture to satisfy non-functional requirements may be a domain requirement.
- This may be the consequence of a regulatory requirement.

#### Guideline to write requirements
- Invent a standard format and use it for all requirements.
- Use language in a consistent way. Use shall for mandatory requirements, should for desirable requirements.
- Use text highlighting to identify key parts of the requirement.
- Avoid the use of computer jargon.
- Include an explanation (rationale) of why a requirement is necessary.

#### Requirement validation
- Requirements validation is the process of checking the requirements for validity, consistency, completeness, realism and verifiability. 
- Concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customer really wants.
- Requirements error costs are high so validation is very important Fixing a requirements error after delivery may cost up to 100 times the cost of fixing an implementation error.

**Criterias to be checked (Requirements checking)**
1. Validity. Does the system provide the functions which best support the customer’s needs?
2. Consistency. Are there any requirements conflicts?
3. Completeness. Are all functions required by the customer included?
4. Realism. Can the requirements be implemented given available budget and technology
5. Verifiability. Can the requirements be checked?

**Requirement validation techniques**
1. Requirements reviews. Systematic manual analysis of the requirements.
2. Prototyping Using an executable model of the system to check requirements. 
3. Test-case generation. Developing tests for requirements to check testability.

**Requirements reviews**
- Regular reviews should be held while the requirements definition is being formulated.
- Both client and contractor staff should be involved in reviews.
- Reviews may be formal (with completed documents) or informal. Good communications between developers, customers and users can resolve problems at an early stage.

**Review checks**
1. Verifiability
- Is the requirement realistically testable?

2. Comprehensibility
- Is the requirement properly understood?

3.Traceability
- Is the origin of the requirement clearly stated?

4. Adaptability
- Can the requirement be changed without a large impact on other requirements?

#### Requirement Management 
Requirements management is the process of managing changing requirements during the requirements engineering process and system development.

**Requiements management planning**

Establishes the level of requirements management detail that is required.

1. Requirements identification Each requirement must be uniquely identified so that it can be cross-referenced with other requirements.
2. A change management process This is the set of activities that assess the impact and cost of changes. I discuss this process in more detail in the following section.
3. Traceability policies These policies define the relationships between each requirement and between the requirements and the system design that should be recorded.
4. Tool support Tools that may be used range from specialist requirements management systems to spreadsheets and simple database systems.

**Process of deciding if a requirement change should be accepted:**
1. Problem analysis and change specification 
During this stage, the problem or the change proposal is analyzed to check that it is valid. This analysis is fed back to the change requestor who may respond with a more specific requirements change proposal, or decide to withdraw the request.

2. Change analysis and costing 
The effect of the proposed change is assessed using traceability information and general knowledge of the system requirements. Once this analysis is completed, a decision is made whether or not to proceed with the requirements change.

3. Change implementation 
The requirements document and, where necessary, the system design and implementation, are modified. Ideally, the document should be organized so that changes can be easily implemented.

## System requirements
- system requirements are the descriptions of the system services and constraints that are generated during the requirements engineering process.
- System requirements are more detailed requirements and may include more technical information.

## System stakeholders
Any person or organization who is affected by the system in some way and so who has a legitimate interest

Types of stakeholders
- End users
- System managers
- System owners
- External stakeholders

### Complete
They should include descriptions of all facilities required.

### Consistency
There should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system facilities.

In practice, because of system and environmental complexity, it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document.
