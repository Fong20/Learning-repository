# 04. Requirements Engineering

## Requirement
Requirements = customer's needs

Types of requirement
1. User requirement = Written for customers
2. System requirement = structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the systemâ€™s functions, services and operational constraints.

## Requirement Engineering
The process of establishing the services that a customer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed.

## System requirements
system requirements are the descriptions of the system services and constraints that are generated during the requirements engineering process.

## System stakeholders
Any person or organization who is affected by the system in some way and so who has a legitimate interest

Types of stakeholders
- End users
- System managers
- System owners
- External stakeholders

## Functional and non-functional requirements

### Functional requirements
- Statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations.
- May state what the system should not do.
  
### Non-functional requirements
- Functional system requirements should describe the system services in detail.
- Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc.
- Often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services.

Types of non-functional classifications:
1. Product requirements
- Requirements which specify that the delivered product must behave in a particular way e.g. execution speed, reliability, etc.

Examples:
- efficiency (performance and space requirements)
- dependability
- security
- usability

#### Usability requirements

2. Organisational requirements
- Requirements which are a consequence of organisational policies and procedures e.g. process standards used, implementation requirements, etc.

3. External requirements
- Requirements which arise from factors which are external to the system and its development process e.g. interoperability requirements, legislative requirements, etc.

Example
- regulatory
- ethical

Importance of non-functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of a system rather than the individual components.  For example, to ensure that performance requirements are met, you may have to organize the system to minimize communications between components.
- A single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate a number of related functional requirements that define system services that are required. It may also generate requirements that restrict existing requirements. 

## Requirements imprecision
Defined as the problem which occur when functional requirements are not precisely stated.

## Requirement completeness and consistency
In principle, requirements should be both complete and consistent.

### Complete
They should include descriptions of all facilities required.

### Consistency
There should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system facilities.

In practice, because of system and environmental complexity, it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document.
