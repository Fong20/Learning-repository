# 03. Agile Software Development
- Rapid development and delivery is now often the most important requirement for software systems. Plan-driven development is essential for some types of system but does not meet these business needs.
- Hence, Agile development methods emerged in the late 1990s whose aim was to radically reduce the delivery time for working software systems

**Main function:**
- reduce overhead in software processes (Eg:limiting documentation)
- meet customer's requirements
- meet changing requirements without excessive rework
  
**Key chracteristics:**
- Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved
- The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation
- Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation
- Extensive tool support (e.g. automated testing tools) used to support development.
- Minimal documentation with more focus on working code

## Principles of agile methods
There are 5 main principles of agile method

1. Customer involvement. Customers are involved in the development process
2. Incremental delivery. The system is developed incrementally with additional customer requirements added into each increment.
3. People not process. The skills of the development team should be recognized and exploited.
4. Embrace change. The system requirements are subjected to change. Thus, the system must be designed in a way to accomodate such changes
5. Maintain simplicity. Focus on simplicity in both the software being developed and in the development process.

## Agile development techniques

### Extreme programming (XP)
Extreme Programming (XP) takes an extreme approach to iterative development.

- New versions may be built several times per day;
- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks;
- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully.

#### Application of Agile Principles in XP
- **Incremental delivery** is supported through small, frequent system releases.
- **Customer involvement** means full-time customer engagement with the team.
- **People not process** through pair programming, collective ownership and a process that avoids long working hours.
- **Embrace change.** System requirement changes are supported through regular system releases.
- **Maintaining simplicity** through constant refactoring of code.

#### Extreme programming practices

There are numerous XP practices but there are few influential practices:
1. User stories for specification
2. Refactoring
3. Test-first development
4. Pair programming

#### User stories for specification
- In XP, a customer or user is part of the XP team and is responsible for making decisions on requirements.
- User requirements are expressed as user stories or scenarios.
- These are written on cards and the development team break them down into implementation tasks. These tasks are the basis of schedule and cost estimates.
- The customer chooses the stories for inclusion in the next release based on their priorities and the schedule estimates.

#### Refactoring
- Conventional wisdom in software engineering is to design for change. It is worth spending time and effort anticipating changes as this reduces costs later in the life cycle.
- XP, however, maintains that this is not worthwhile as changes cannot be reliably anticipated.
- Rather, it proposes constant **code improvement (refactoring)** to make changes easier when they have to be implemented.
- Programming team look for possible software improvements and make these improvements even where there is no immediate need for them.
- This improves the understandability of the software and so reduces the need for documentation.
- Changes are also easier to make because the code is well-structured and clear.

**Examples of refactoring**
1. Re-organization of a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code.
2. Tidying up and renaming attributes and methods to make them easier to understand.
3. The replacement of inline code with calls to methods that have been included in a program library.

#### Test-first development
Testing is central to XP and XP has developed an approach where the program is tested after every change has been made.

**XP testing features:**
1. Incremental test development from scenarios.
2. User involvement in test development and validation.
3. Automated test harnesses are used to run all component tests each time that a new release is built.

**Shortcomings with test-first development**
- Programmers prefer programming to testing and sometimes they take short cuts when writing tests. For example, they may write incomplete tests that do not check for all possible exceptions that may occur.
- Some tests can be very difficult to write incrementally. For example, in a complex user interface, it is often difficult to write unit tests for the code that implements the ‘display logic’ and workflow between screens.
- It difficult to judge the completeness of a set of tests. Although you may have a lot of system tests, your test set may not provide complete coverage.  

#### Test-driven development
- Involves the process of Writing tests before code clarifies the requirements to be implemented.
- Tests are written as programs rather than data so that they can be executed automatically. The test includes a check that it has executed correctly.
- All previous and new tests are run automatically when new functionality is added, thus checking that the new functionality has not introduced errors.

#### Customer involvement in testing
- The role of the customer in the testing process is to **help develop acceptance tests for the stories that are to be implemented in the next release of the system.**
- The customer who is part of the team writes tests as development proceeds. All new code is therefore validated to ensure that it is what the customer needs.
- However, people adopting the customer role have limited time available and so cannot work full-time with the development team. They may feel that providing the requirements was enough of a contribution and so may be reluctant to get involved in the testing process. 

#### Pair programming
- Pair programming involves programmers working in pairs, developing code together. This helps develop common ownership of code and spreads knowledge across the team.
- It serves as an informal review process as each line of code is looked at by more than 1 person.
- It encourages refactoring as the whole team can benefit from improving the system code.

## Agile project management
- The principal responsibility of software project managers is to manage the project so that the software is delivered on time and within the planned budget for the project.
- The standard approach to project management is plan-driven. Managers draw up a plan for the project showing what should be delivered, when it should be delivered and who will work on the development of the project deliverables.
- Agile project management requires a different approach, which is adapted to incremental development and the practices used in agile methods. 

### Scrum
Scrum is an agile method that provides a project management framework. 

#### Phases of Scrum
1. outline planning phase where you establish the general objectives for the project and design the software architecture.
2. series of sprint cycles, where each cycle develops an increment of the system.
3. project closure phase wraps up the project, completes required documentation such as system help frames and user manuals and assesses the lessons learned from the project.

#### Scrum terminology

#### Scrum sprint cycle
- Sprints are fixed length, normally 2–4 weeks.
- The starting point for planning is the product backlog, which is the list of work to be done on the project.
- The selection phase involves all of the project team who work with the customer to select the features and functionality from the product backlog to be developed during the sprint.
- Once these are agreed, the team organize themselves to develop the software.
- During this stage the team is isolated from the customer and the organization, with all communications channelled through the so-called ‘Scrum master’.
- The role of the Scrum master is to protect the development team from external distractions.
- At the end of the sprint, the work done is reviewed and presented to stakeholders.
- The next sprint cycle then begins.

#### Benefits of Scrum
- The product is broken down into a set of manageable and understandable chunks.
- Unstable requirements do not hold up progress.
- The whole team have visibility of everything and consequently team communication is improved.
- Customers see on-time delivery of increments and gain feedback on how the product works.
- Trust between customers and developers is established and a positive culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.

## Scaling agile methods
- Agile methods have proved to be successful for small and medium sized projects that can be developed by a small co-located team.
- The success of these methods could be due to the improved communications which is possible when everyone is working together.
- Scaling up agile methods involves changing these to cope with larger, longer projects where there are multiple development teams, perhaps working in different locations.

## Scaling out vs Scaling up
Scaling up = Usage of agile methods for developing large software systems that cannot be developed by a small team.

Scaling out = how agile methods can be introduced across a large organization with many years of software development experience.

## Drawbacks of agile
1. Contractual issues
2. Software Maintenance (Lack of documentation, development team would not always work on the system as they may switch workplaces)
3. Scaling agile methods for large systems is difficult.
 Large systems need up-front design and some documentation and organizational practice may conflict with the informality of agile approaches.
