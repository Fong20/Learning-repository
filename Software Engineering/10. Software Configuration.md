# 10. Software Configuration
- Software systems are constantly changing during development and use.
- Configuration management (CM) is concerned with the policies, processes and tools for managing changing software systems.
- You need CM because it is easy to lose track of what changes and component versions have been incorporated into each system version.
- CM is essential for team projects to control changes made by different developers

## Configuration Management Activities
1. Version management
- Keeping track of the multiple versions of system components and ensuring that changes made to components by different developers do not interfere with each other. 

2. System building 
- The process of assembling program components, data and libraries, then compiling these to create an executable system.

3. Change management 
- Keeping track of requests for changes to the software from customers and developers, working out the costs and impact of changes, and deciding the changes should be implemented.

4. Release management 
- Preparing software for external release and keeping track of the system versions that have been released for customer use.

## Development phases
- A development phase where the development team is responsible for managing the software configuration and new functionality is being added to the software.
- A system testing phase where a version of the system is released internally for testing.
- No new system functionality is added. Changes made are bug fixes, performance improvements and security vulnerability repairs.
- A release phase where the software is released to customers for use.
- New versions of the released system are developed to repair bugs and vulnerabilities and to include new features. 

## Multi-version systems
- For large systems, there is never just one ‘working’ version of a system. 
- There are always several versions of the system at different stages of development.
- There may be several teams involved in the development of different system versions.

### Codeline
- A codeline is a sequence of versions of  source code with later versions in the sequence derived from earlier versions. 
- Codelines normally apply to components of systems so that there are different versions of each component.

### Baseline
- A baseline is a definition of a specific system.
- The baseline therefore specifies the component versions that are included in the system plus a specification of the libraries used, configuration files, etc.
- Baselines may be specified using a configuration language, which allows you to define what components are included in a version of a particular system.
- Baselines are important because you often have to recreate a specific version of a complete system.
- For example, a product line may be instantiated so that there are individual system versions for different customers. You may have to recreate the version delivered to a specific customer if, for example, that customer reports bugs in their system that have to be repaired.

## Version management
- Version management (VM) is the process of keeping track of different versions of software components or configuration items and the systems in which these components are used.
- It also involves ensuring that changes made by different developers to these versions do not interfere with each other.
- Therefore version management can be thought of as the process of managing codelines and baselines. 

## Version control systems
- Version control (VC) systems identify, store and control access to the different versions of components. There are two types of modern version control system
- Centralized systems, where there is a single master repository that maintains all versions of the software components that are being developed. Subversion is a widely used example of a centralized VC system.
- Distributed systems, where multiple versions of the component repository exist at the same time. Git is a widely-used example of a distributed VC system. 

### Key-features of version control systems
- Version and release identification
- Change history recording
- Support for independent development
- Project support
- Storage management

### Public repository and private workspaces
- To support independent development without interference, version control systems use the concept of a project repository and a private workspace.
- The project repository maintains the ‘master’ version of all components. It is used to create baselines for system building.
- When modifying components, developers copy (check-out) these from the repository into their workspace and work on these copies.
- When they have finished their changes, the changed components are returned (checked-in) to the repository. 

### Centralized version control
- Developers check out components or directories of components from the project repository into their private workspace and work on these copies in their private workspace.
- When their changes are complete, they check-in the components back to the repository.
- If several people are working on a component at the same time, each check it out from the repository. If a component has been checked out, the VC system warns other users wanting to check out that component that it has been checked out by someone else. 

**Example: Repository Check-in/Check-Out**

### Distributed version control
- A ‘master’ repository is created on a server that maintains the code produced by the development team.
- Instead of checking out the files that they need, a developer creates a clone of the project repository that is downloaded and installed on their computer.
- Developers work on the files required and maintain the new versions on their private repository on their own computer.
- When changes are done, they ‘commit’ these changes and update their private server repository.  They may then ‘push’ these changes to the project repository. 

#### Benefits
- It provides a backup mechanism for the repository.
- If the repository is corrupted, work can continue and the project repository can be restored from local copies.
- It allows for off-line working so that developers can commit changes if they do not have a network connection.
- Project support is the default way of working. Developers can compile and test the entire system on their local machines and test the changes that they have made. 

**Example: Distributed version control**

#### Distributed version control in open source development
- Distributed version control is essential for open source development. Several people may be working simultaneously on the same system without any central coordination. 
- As well as a private repository on their own computer, developers also maintain a public server repository to which they push new versions of components that they have changed. It is then up to the open-source system ‘manager’ to decide when to pull these changes into the definitive system.

### Branching and merging
- Rather than a linear sequence of versions that reflect changes to the component over time, there may be several independent sequences.
- This is normal in system development, where different developers work independently on different versions of the source code and so change it in different ways.
- At some stage, it may be necessary to merge codeline branches to create a new version of a component that includes all changes that have been made.
- If the changes made involve different parts of the code, the component versions may be merged automatically by combining the deltas that apply to the code.

### Storage management
- When version control systems were first developed, storage management was one of their most important functions.
- Disk space was expensive and it was important to minimize the disk space used by the different copies of components.
- Instead of keeping a complete copy of each version, the system stores a list of differences (deltas) between one version and another.
- By applying these to a master version (usually the most recent version), a target version can be recreated.

#### Storage management using Git
- As disk storage is now relatively cheap, Git uses an alternative, faster approach.
- Git does not use deltas but applies a standard compression algorithm to stored files and their associated meta-information.
- It does not store duplicate copies of files.  Retrieving a file simply involves decompressing it, with no need to apply a chain of operations.
- Git also uses the notion of packfiles where several smaller files are combined into an indexed single file. 

## System building
- System building is the process of creating a complete, executable system by compiling and linking the system components, external libraries, configuration files, etc.
- System building tools and version management tools must communicate as the build process involves checking out component versions from the repository managed by the version management system.
- The configuration description used to identify a baseline is also used by the system building tool.

### Build platforms
- The development system, which includes development tools such as compilers, source code editors, etc.
- Developers check out code from the version management system into a private workspace before making changes to the system.
- The build server, which is used to build definitive, executable versions of the system.
- Developers check-in code to the version management system before it is built. The system build may rely on external libraries that are not included in the version management system.
- The target environment, which is the platform on which the system executes. 

### System platforms
- The development system, which includes development tools such as compilers, source code editors, etc.
- The build server, which is used to build definitive, executable versions of the system. This server maintains the definitive versions of a system.
- The target environment, which is the platform on which the system executes.  For real-time and embedded systems, the target environment is often smaller and simpler than the development environment (e.g. a cell phone)

### Agile building (continuous integration)
- Check out the mainline system from the version management system into the developer’s private workspace.
- Build the system and run automated tests to ensure that the built system passes all tests. If not, the build is broken and you should inform whoever checked in the last baseline system. They are responsible for repairing the problem.
- Make the changes to the system components.
- Build the system in the private workspace and rerun system tests. If the tests fail, continue editing.
- Once the system has passed its tests, check it into the build system but do not commit it as a new system baseline.
- Build the system on the build server and run the tests. You need to do this in case others have modified components since you checked out the system. If this is the case, check out the components that have failed and edit these so that tests pass on your private workspace.
- If the system passes its tests on the build system, then commit the changes you have made as a new baseline in the system mainline.

**Example of continuous integration**

#### Benefits of continuous integration
- The advantage of continuous integration is that it allows problems caused by the interactions between different developers to be discovered and repaired as soon as possible.
- The most recent system in the mainline is the definitive working system. 

#### Disadvantages of continuous integration
- If the system is very large, it may take a long time to build and test, especially if integration with other application systems is involved.
- If the development platform is different from the target platform, it may not be possible to run system tests in the developer’s private workspace. 

### Daily building
The development organization sets a delivery time (say 2 p.m.) for system components. 
If developers have new versions of the components that they are writing, they must deliver them by that time. 
A new version of the system is built from these components by compiling and linking them to form a complete system.
This system is then delivered to the testing team, which carries out a set of predefined system tests
Faults that are discovered during system testing are documented and returned to the system developers. They repair these faults in a subsequent version of the component.


### Minimizing recompilation
- Tools to support system building are usually designed to minimize the amount of compilation that is required.
- They do this by checking if a compiled version of a component is available. If so, there is no need to recompile that component.
- A unique signature identifies each source and object code version and is changed when the source code is edited.
- By comparing the signatures on the source and object code files, it is possible to decide if the source code was used to generate the object code component.

### File identification

1. **Modification timestamps**
- The signature on the source code file is the time and date when that file was modified. If the source code file of a component has been modified after the related object code file, then the system assumes that recompilation to create a new object code file is necessary. 

2. **Source code checksums** 
- The signature on the source code file is a checksum calculated from data in the file. A checksum function calculates a unique number using the source text as input. If you change the source code (even by 1 character), this will generate a different checksum. You can therefore be confident that source code files with different checksums are actually different. 

### Timestamps vs checksums

1. Timestamps
Because source and object files are linked by name rather than an explicit source file signature, it is not usually possible to build different versions of a source code component into the same directory at the same time, as these would generate object files with the same name. 

2. Checksums
When you recompile a component, it does not overwrite the object code, as would normally be the case when the timestamp is used. Rather, it generates a new object code file and tags it with the source code signature. Parallel compilation is possible and different versions of a component may be compiled at the same time.

## Change management
- Organizational needs and requirements change during the lifetime of a system, bugs have to be repaired and systems have to adapt to changes in their environment.
- Change management is intended to ensure that system evolution is a managed process and that priority is given to the most urgent and cost-effective changes.
- The change management process is concerned with analyzing the costs and benefits of proposed changes, approving those changes that are worthwhile and tracking which components in the system have been changed.

### Factors in change analysis
- The consequences of not making the change
- The benefits of the change
- The number of users affected by the change
- The costs of making the change
- The product release cycle

### Change management and agile methods
- In some agile methods, customers are directly involved in change management.
- The propose a change to the requirements and work with the team to assess its impact and decide whether the change should take priority over the features planned for the next increment of the system.
- Changes to improve the software improvement are decided by the programmers working on the system.
- Refactoring, where the software is continually improved, is not seen as an overhead but as a necessary part of the development process. 

## Release management
- A system release is a version of a software system that is distributed to customers.
- For mass market software, it is usually possible to identify two types of release: major releases which deliver significant new functionality, and minor releases, which repair bugs and fix customer problems that have been reported.
- For custom software or software product lines, releases of the system may have to be produced for each customer and individual customers may be running several different releases of the system at the same time. 

### Release components
Besides the executable code of the system, a release may also include:

- configuration files defining how the release should be configured for particular installations;
- data files, such as files of error messages, that are needed for successful system operation;
- an installation program that is used to help install the system on target hardware;
- electronic and paper documentation describing the system;
- packaging and associated publicity that have been designed for that release.

### Factors influencing system release planning

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201f18ef-9d63-4338-b906-dffb38ecb5eb)

### Release creation
- The executable code of the programs and all associated data files must be identified in the version control system.
- Configuration descriptions may have to be written for different hardware and operating systems.
- Update instructions may have to be written for customers who need to configure their own systems.
- Scripts for the installation program may have to be written.
- Web pages have to be created describing the release, with links to system documentation.
- When all information is available, an executable master image of the software must be prepared and handed over for distribution to customers or sales outlets.

### Release tracking
- In the event of a problem, it may be necessary to reproduce exactly the software that has been delivered to a particular customer.
- When a system release is produced, it must be documented to ensure that it can be re-created exactly in the future.
- This is particularly important for customized, long-lifetime embedded systems, such as those that control complex machines.
- Customers may use a single release of these systems for many years and may require specific changes to a particular software system long after its original release date.

### Release reproduction
- To document a release, you have to record the specific versions of the source code components that were used to create the executable code.
- You must keep copies of the source code files, corresponding executables and all data and configuration files.
- You should also record the versions of the operating system, libraries, compilers and other tools used to build the software. 

### Release planning
- As well as the technical work involved in creating a release distribution, advertising and publicity material have to be prepared and marketing strategies put in place to convince customers to buy the new release of the system. 

#### Release timing
- If releases are too frequent or require hardware upgrades, customers may not move to the new release, especially if they have to pay for it.
- If system releases are  too infrequent, market share may be lost as customers move to alternative systems. 

### Software as a service
- Delivering software as a service (SaaS) reduces the problems of release management.
- It simplifies both release management and system installation for customers.
- The software developer is responsible for replacing the existing release of a system with a new release and this is made available to all customers at the same time.
