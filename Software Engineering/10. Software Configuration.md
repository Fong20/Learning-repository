# 10. Software Configuration
- Software systems are constantly changing during development and use.
- Configuration management (CM) is concerned with the policies, processes and tools for managing changing software systems.
- You need CM because it is easy to lose track of what changes and component versions have been incorporated into each system version.
- CM is essential for team projects to control changes made by different developers

## Configuration Management Activities
1. Version management
- Keeping track of the multiple versions of system components and ensuring that changes made to components by different developers do not interfere with each other. 

2. System building 
- The process of assembling program components, data and libraries, then compiling these to create an executable system.

3. Change management 
- Keeping track of requests for changes to the software from customers and developers, working out the costs and impact of changes, and deciding the changes should be implemented.

4. Release management 
- Preparing software for external release and keeping track of the system versions that have been released for customer use.

## Development phases
- A development phase where the development team is responsible for managing the software configuration and new functionality is being added to the software.
- A system testing phase where a version of the system is released internally for testing.
- No new system functionality is added. Changes made are bug fixes, performance improvements and security vulnerability repairs.
- A release phase where the software is released to customers for use.
- New versions of the released system are developed to repair bugs and vulnerabilities and to include new features. 

## Multi-version systems
- For large systems, there is never just one ‘working’ version of a system. 
- There are always several versions of the system at different stages of development.
- There may be several teams involved in the development of different system versions.

### Codeline
- A codeline is a sequence of versions of  source code with later versions in the sequence derived from earlier versions. 
- Codelines normally apply to components of systems so that there are different versions of each component.

### Baseline
- A baseline is a definition of a specific system.
- The baseline therefore specifies the component versions that are included in the system plus a specification of the libraries used, configuration files, etc.
- Baselines may be specified using a configuration language, which allows you to define what components are included in a version of a particular system.
- Baselines are important because you often have to recreate a specific version of a complete system.
- For example, a product line may be instantiated so that there are individual system versions for different customers. You may have to recreate the version delivered to a specific customer if, for example, that customer reports bugs in their system that have to be repaired.

## Version management
- Version management (VM) is the process of keeping track of different versions of software components or configuration items and the systems in which these components are used.
- It also involves ensuring that changes made by different developers to these versions do not interfere with each other.
- Therefore version management can be thought of as the process of managing codelines and baselines. 

## Version control systems
- Version control (VC) systems identify, store and control access to the different versions of components. There are two types of modern version control system
- Centralized systems, where there is a single master repository that maintains all versions of the software components that are being developed. Subversion is a widely used example of a centralized VC system.
- Distributed systems, where multiple versions of the component repository exist at the same time. Git is a widely-used example of a distributed VC system. 

### Key-features of version control systems
- Version and release identification
- Change history recording
- Support for independent development
- Project support
- Storage management

### Public repository and private workspaces
- To support independent development without interference, version control systems use the concept of a project repository and a private workspace.
- The project repository maintains the ‘master’ version of all components. It is used to create baselines for system building.
- When modifying components, developers copy (check-out) these from the repository into their workspace and work on these copies.
- When they have finished their changes, the changed components are returned (checked-in) to the repository.
