# 01. Introduction to Computational Intelligence
- Systems which operate using Classical control rely on exact, complete, and precise data for its operation. However, Modern technologies, ranging from industrial processes to home appliances—are becoming increasingly complex and dynamic, and these systems are often operate in uncertain, ambiguous, or incomplete environments, where classical control methods fall short.
- Computational Intelligence (CI) was introduced to address this challenge by mimicking the human mind’s ability to make reasonable decisions under uncertainty.

## Classical Control Systems vs Intelligent Control Systems

### Classical Control Systems
- Classical Control Systems work only when all required data is known, precise, and complete. It cannot adapt to uncertain and ambiguous changes
- It is a form of hard computing

#### Hard Computing
- Works with strict rules: true/false, valid/invalid.
- Focus on precision and accuracy.
- Example: A calculator returning the exact result of 2 + 2 = 4.

### Intelligent Control Systems
- Designed to handle incomplete data and uncertainty, just as humans do. They began appearing in the 1960s–1970s and became more popular in the 2000s with advances in computing.
- It is a form of soft computing

#### Soft Computing 
- Soft Computing is inspired by the human brain’s ability to deal with **partial truth, vagueness, and imprecision.** Unlike 'hard computing,' it accepts approximate solutions that are good enough for decision-making.
- Works with approximations, reasoning, and uncertainty.
- Deals with degrees of truth, partial values, or imprecise inputs.
- Example: An air conditioner using fuzzy logic to adjust cooling depending on 'slightly warm,' 'warm,' or 'very hot,' instead of exact temperature thresholds.

## Elements of Computational Intelligence

### 1. Evolutionary Computations
- Inspired by natural evolution.
- Applications: Data mining, clustering, scheduling, approximation, route optimization.

### 2. Artificial Neural Networks
- Inspired by the brain’s network of neurons.
- Applications: Speech recognition, image processing, disease diagnosis, pattern recognition, game strategy planning.

### 3. Fuzzy Systems
- Inspired by human reasoning with vague concepts.
- Applications: Control systems, gear transmission, household appliances, and traffic light control.

## Fuzzy Logic vs Classical Logic

### Classical Logic (Crisp Logic)
- Classical logic, first developed by the Greeks, assigns every statement a strict truth value: True (1/ON) or False (0/OFF). This binary approach works well for precise cases but fails to handle ambiguity or 'in-between' situations. It struggles with gradual changes or vague definitions.
- Classical logic is often used to explain fuzzy logic concepts, but fuzzy logic is more flexible and realistic in practical scenarios.

**Example: speed classification with a limit at 90 km/h**
- Under classical logic: Any speed below 90 = 'Slow' (False), 90 and above = 'Fast' (True).
- Issue: A speed of 89.9 km/h is treated the same as 20 km/h (both 'Slow'), while 90 km/h and 100000 km/h are treated the same (both 'Fast').

#### Classical Logic Controller
- In a Classical Closed loop Control System, the objective is to control the process based on sensor feedback. All Data in the system are Crisp.
- For example, Speed Cruise Control

### Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy Logic solves the issue of classical logic by using values ranging between 0 and 1 to represent degrees of truth.

**Example: speed classification with fuzzy logic**
- 20 km/h → 0.2 = 'Very very slow'
- 40 km/h → 0.4 = 'Very slow'
- 60 km/h → 0.6 = 'Slow'
- 80 km/h → 0.8 = 'Kind of slow'
- 89.9 km/h → 0.85 = 'Almost fast'
- 90 km/h → 0.9 = 'Fast'
- 100 km/h → 0.99 = 'Very fast'
- 100000 km/h → 0.9999 = 'Extremely fast'

#### Fuzzy Logic Controller
The Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) extends classical control by introducing fuzzy concepts. This makes FLCs highly effective in handling uncertainty, imprecise data, and non-linear systems.

**It includes three main components:**
- Fuzzification: Converts crisp input data into fuzzy data.
- Inference: Applies a fuzzy rule base to infer decisions.
- Defuzzification: Converts fuzzy results back into crisp outputs for action.
