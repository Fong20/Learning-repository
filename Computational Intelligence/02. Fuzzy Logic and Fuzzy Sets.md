# 02. Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Sets

Crisp = things which are 100% based on true on false , 0 or 1 
Fuzzy = accept things with varying of degree, which are essentially things are not 100% fixed true or false

## Boolean / Conventional Logic
- a boundary value is set to distinguish a charactersitic
- fixed true or false, 0 or 1

## Crisp set vs Fuzzy Set

### Important terms
1. Universe
- Universe: physical meaning. It is essentially what does the data mean in the physical world

Example: Class registration
- 0 means not registered
- 1 means registered


### Crisp Set
In crisp set, an element either belongs to a set or does not belong to a set.

fA(x) : X → 0, 1 = characteristic function of crisp set A part of universe X

where

fA(x) =

1, if x ∈ A
0, if x /∈ A

### Fuzzy Set
- Fuzzy set introduces a new element which is a unique membership function, μA. **The value of a membership function represents the degree of membership**,or
called the membership value of x in set A. Hence, it also influences the logic graph.
- The membership function is not unique, it is basically a series of mathematical formulas.
- In fuzzy sets, a data could be part of multiple sets with varying degrees. For example, a short person could be 90% short and 10% tall

Fuzzyset A of universe X is defined byitsmembershipfunction μA

μA(x) : X → [0, 1]

where

μA(x) =1 if x is totally in A;

μA(x) =0 if x is not in A;

0 < μA(x) < 1 if x is partly in A.
