# 02. Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Sets

Crisp = things which are 100% based on true on false , 0 or 1 

Fuzzy = accept things with varying of degree, which are essentially things are not 100% fixed true or false

## Boolean / Conventional Logic
- a boundary value is set to distinguish a charactersitic
- fixed true or false, 0 or 1

## Crisp set vs Fuzzy Set

### Important terms
**1. Universe**
- Universe: physical meaning. It is essentially what does the data mean in the physical world

Example: Class registration
- 0 means not registered
- 1 means registered

**2. Membership Function**
- A membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or degree of membership) between 0 and 1
- The membership function is basically a series of mathematical formulas.

### Crisp Set
- In crisp set, an element either belongs to a set or does not belong to a set. Thus, there is no fuzziness in the membership function.

fA(x) : X → 0, 1 = characteristic function of crisp set A part of universe X

where

fA(x) =

1, if x ∈ A
0, if x /∈ A

#### Representation of elements in Crisp Set

(data value of the universe, truth value)

**Example:**

Universe X value = 155,162,172,178,182

3 membership function
- short men
- average men
- tall men

When the universe value is part of the set, the truth value will be 1. otherwise, it will be 0

### Fuzzy Set
Fuzzy set introduced fuzziness into the membership function, μA. **The value of a membership function represents the degree of membership**, or called the membership value of x in set A. Hence, it also influences the logic graph.

**Example: Crisp Membership Function vs Fuzzy Membership Function**

<img width="720" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdff8eab-c3bd-49c5-b083-4163b273e270" />

Fuzzy set A of universe X is defined by its membership function μA

μA(x) : X → [0, 1], [] represents different degrees of value from 0 to 1

where

μA(x) =1 if x is totally in A;

μA(x) =0 if x is not in A;

0 < μA(x) < 1 if x is partly in A.

- In fuzzy sets, a data could be part of multiple sets with varying degrees. For example, a short person could be 90% short and 10% tall

#### Hedges
- Hedges act as operations.
- When a hedge is applied on a linguistic value, it changes the shape of the fuzzy set.
- Hedge is unique and it is defined by the user itself.
- For example, if ‘very’ is applied to a linguistic value A, it changes the shape from μA to (μA)2

## Operations
- operations can be applied on both crisp sets and fuzzy sets

These sets interact with one another through operations such as:
1. Equality
2. Complement (NOT)
3. Containment (subset)
4. Intersection (AND)
5. Union (OR)

### 1. Equality Operator
In order for two sets to be equal, the element values in both sets must be the same. This applies to both crisp set and fuzzy set.

### 2. Complement (NOT)
- For crisp set, the complement of the set is the element values which are not found in the set
- For fuzzy set, the complement of the set is 1 - each of the element values in the set

### 3. Containment (subset)
- For crisp set, set A is said to be subset of set B when all the element values of set A are found in the set B
- For fuzzy set, set A is said to be a subset of set B when the membership values for each element in A is less than or equal to the membership value of the corresponding element in B.

### 4. Intersection (AND)
- For the crisp set, the intersection of two sets is the elements found in both set
- For the fuzzy set, the intersection of two sets is the comparison and selection of minimum value of each elements in the fuzzy set

### 5. Union
- For the crisp set, the union of two sets is the combination of all elements found in both sets.
- For fuzzy set, the union of two sets is the comparison and selection of maximum value of each elements in the fuzzy set
