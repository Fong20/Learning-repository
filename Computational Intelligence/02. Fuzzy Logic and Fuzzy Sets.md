# 02. Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Sets

Crisp = things which are 100% based on true on false , 0 or 1 
Fuzzy = accept things with varying of degree, which are essentially things are not 100% fixed true or false

## Boolean / Conventional Logic
- a boundary value is set to distinguish a charactersitic
- fixed true or false, 0 or 1

## Crisp set vs Fuzzy Set

### Important terms
1. Universe
- Universe: physical meaning. It is essentially what does the data mean in the physical world

Example: Class registration
- 0 means not registered
- 1 means registered


### Crisp Set
- In crisp set, an element either belongs to a set or does not belong to a set. Thus, there is no fuzziness in the membership function.

fA(x) : X → 0, 1 = characteristic function of crisp set A part of universe X

where

fA(x) =

1, if x ∈ A
0, if x /∈ A

#### Representation of elements in Crisp Set

(data value of the universe, truth value)

**Example:**

Universe X value = 155,162,172,178,182

3 membership function
- short men
- average men
- tall men

When the universe value is part of the set, the truth value will be 1. otherwise, it will be 0

### Fuzzy Set
- Fuzzy set has a unique membership function, μA. **The value of a membership function represents the degree of membership**, or called the membership value of x in set A. Hence, it also influences the logic graph.
- The membership function is basically a series of mathematical formulas.

Fuzzyset A of universe X is defined byitsmembershipfunction μA

μA(x) : X → [0, 1], [] represents different degrees of value from 0 to 1

where

μA(x) =1 if x is totally in A;

μA(x) =0 if x is not in A;

0 < μA(x) < 1 if x is partly in A.

- In fuzzy sets, a data could be part of multiple sets with varying degrees. For example, a short person could be 90% short and 10% tall

#### Hedges
- Hedges act as operations.
- When a hedge is applied on a linguistic value, it changes the shape  of the fuzzy set.
- Hedge is unique and it is defined by the user itself.
