# 04. Genetic Algorithms
- Genetic algorithm is an optimisation process of which the purpose is toidentifythechromosome with thebestcombinationofgenes.
- It aims to solve an optimisation problem in which we are by optimising the values of the chromosome and maximising the fitness of the chromosome
- Genetic algorithm mimics the biological evolution

## Biological Evolution
Charles Darwin developed the theory of natural selection which became the foundation of biological evolution.

## Darwin's theory of evolution, reproduction, and mutation

### First part
this isaworldwithlimitedresourcesandstablepopulations.
▶ Each individualcompeteswithothersforsurvival.
▶ Individuals with good characteristicsaremorelikelyto surviveand reproduce.
▶ Characteristicsarepassedontotheiroffsprings.
▶ Overtime,thesegoodcharacteristicsbecomedominantamongthepopulation

These processes(natural selection, survival of the fittest, reproduction, and mutation) for the fundamental components for the genetic algorithm.

### Seocnd Part

## Genetic algorithm terminologies

1. Chromosome
Each member in a population is considered as an individual chromosome.

2. Genes
- The character isticsofanindividualareencodedas genes in thechromosome.

## Genetic algorithm steps

### 1. Problem formulation

#### Encoding


#### Fitness function
- The fitness of an individual represents how well the individual can survive and reproduce.
- Therefore, a fitness function has to be carefully designed for meaningful comparison of fitness between different individuals.
- The fitness function takes input of a chromosome representation and produces a scalar value which represents the fitness of the chromosome.
- The higher the fitness value,the higher chance the chromosome will survive and be selected for reproduction.

### 2. Initialisation of Population


### 3. Reproduction

#### Crossover
Sexual = two chromosone
Asexual = only one chromosome
multi-recombination = more than 3 chromosome

**Sexual crossover**

**Asexual crossover**

### 4. Mutation
- Mutation aims to introduce new genetic material intoanexistingindividual,thus increases the diversity ofthepopulation.
- The mutation probability/mutation rate, pm is usually small.

Mutation is implemented using
- uniform (random) mutation 
- inorder mutation.

### 5. Replacement of Population
- In this step, All childrenareselected;allparentsarediscarded;Allchildrenareusedasthe currentgenerationtoreplacethepopulation.
- Childrenandparentsare then selectedbasedonfitness.

## Selection
In selection, the fitness comes to play

### Selective Pressure
- The selectionoperatorsarecharacterisedbytheir selectivepressure.
- Selectivepressureisdefinedas the speed at which the best solution will occupy the entire population byrepeatedapplicationoftheselectionoperatoralone.
- High selectivepressure decreases diversity (thuslimitingtheexplorationabilitiesof

Low selectivepressure increasesthe time toconvergence.
