# 04. Genetic Algorithms
- Genetic algorithm is an optimisation process of which the purpose is toidentifythechromosome with thebestcombinationofgenes.
- It aims to solve an optimisation problem in which we are by optimising the values of the chromosome and maximising the fitness of the chromosome
- Genetic algorithm mimics the biological evolution

## Biological Evolution
Charles Darwindevelopedthetheoryof naturalselection which becamethe foundationofbiologicalevolution.

## Darwin's theory of evolution, reproduction, and mutation

### First part
this isaworldwithlimitedresourcesandstablepopulations.
▶ Each individualcompeteswithothersforsurvival.
▶ Individuals with good characteristicsaremorelikelyto surviveand reproduce.
▶ Characteristicsarepassedontotheiroffsprings.
▶ Overtime,thesegoodcharacteristicsbecomedominantamongthepopulation

These processes(naturalselection, survivalofthefittest, reproduction, and mutation) formthefundamentalcomponentsforthegeneticalgorithm.

### Seocnd Part

## Genetic algorithm terminologies

1. Chromosome
Each member in a population is considered as an individual chromosome.

2. Genes
- The character isticsofanindividualareencodedas genes in thechromosome.

## Genetic algorithm steps

### 1. Problem formulation

#### Encoding


#### Fitness function
- The fitnessofanindividualrepresentshowwelltheindividualcansurviveand reproduce.
- Thereforeafitnessfunctionhastobecarefullydesignedformeaningful comparison offitnessbetweendifferentindividuals.
- The fitnessfunctiontakesinputofachromosomerepresentationandproducesa scalar valuewhichrepresentsthefitnessofthechromosome.
- The higherthefitnessvalue,thehigherchancethechromosomewillsurviveand be selectedforreproduction.

### 2. Initialisation of Population


### 3. Reproduction

#### Crossover
Sexual = two chromosone
Asexual = only one chromosome
multi-recombination = more than 3 chromosome

**Sexual crossover**

**Asexual crossover**

### 4. Mutation
- Mutation aimsto introduce new genetic material intoanexistingindividual,thus increases the diversity ofthepopulation.
- The mutationprobability/mutationrate, pm is usuallysmall.

Mutation is implemented using
- uniform (random) mutation 
- inorder mutation.

### 5. Replacement of Population
- In this step, All childrenareselected;allparentsarediscarded;Allchildrenareusedasthe currentgenerationtoreplacethepopulation.
- Childrenandparentsare then selectedbasedonfitness.

## Selection
In selection, the fitness comes to play

### Selective Pressure
- The selectionoperatorsarecharacterisedbytheir selectivepressure.
- Selectivepressureisdefinedas the speed at which the best solution will occupy the entire population byrepeatedapplicationoftheselectionoperatoralone.
- High selectivepressure decreases diversity (thuslimitingtheexplorationabilitiesof
the population),mayleadtoprematureconvergencetosuboptimalsolutions.
Low selectivepressure increasesthe time toconvergence.
