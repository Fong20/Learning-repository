# 04. Genetic Algorithms
- Genetic algorithm is an optimisation process of which the purpose is toidentifythechromosome with thebestcombinationofgenes.
- It aims to solve an optimisation problem in which we are by optimising the values of the chromosome and maximising the fitness of the chromosome
- Genetic algorithm mimics the biological evolution

## Biological Evolution
Charles Darwin developed the theory of natural selection which became the foundation of biological evolution.

## Darwin's theory of evolution, reproduction, and mutation

### First part

▶ Each individualcompeteswithothersforsurvival.
▶ Individuals with good characteristicsaremorelikelyto surviveand reproduce.
▶ Characteristicsarepassedontotheiroffsprings.
▶ Overtime,thesegoodcharacteristicsbecomedominantamongthepopulation

These processes(natural selection, survival of the fittest, reproduction, and mutation) for the fundamental components for the genetic algorithm.

### Second Part

## Genetic algorithm terminologies

**1. Chromosome**
- Each member in a population is considered as an individual chromosome.

**2. Genes**
- Genes are described as the characteristics of the chromosome

## Genetic algorithm process
The genetic algorithm process consists of 6 steps.

1. Problem Formulation
2. Initialisation of Population
3. Reproduction (Selection + Crossover)
4. Mutation
5. Replacement of population
6. Termination of process

### 1. Problem formulation

#### Encoding


#### Fitness function
- The fitness of an individual represents how well the individual can survive and reproduce.
- Therefore, a fitness function has to be carefully designed for meaningful comparison of fitness between different individuals.
- The fitness function takes input of a chromosome representation and produces a scalar value which represents the fitness of the chromosome.
- The higher the fitness value,the higher chance the chromosome will survive and be selected for reproduction.

### 2. Initialisation of Population
- The initialisation of population is generated with n number of chromosomes with random value assigned to the genes
- The larger the size of the initial population, n, the larger the number of possible solutions but it requires larger computational power.

### 3. Reproduction

#### Selection
Selection is the process of retaining the best performing bit strings from one generation to the next generation.

**Types of selection methods:**
1. Random selection
2. Proportional selection
3. Tournament selection
4. Rank-based selection

#### Crossover
Crossover is a genetic operator used to vary the programming of a chromosome or chromosomes from one generation to the next. 

**Types of crossover methods:**
**1. Sexual**
- For one point crossover, choose a random crossover point to cut at the parent chromosome and change the bits on the right side.
- For two point crossover, choose two random crossover point to cut at the parent chromosome and change the bits on the middle section.
- In uniform crossover, each bit is selected randomly from one of the corresponding bits of the parent chromosomes.

### 4. Mutation
- Mutation aims to introduce new genetic material into an existing individual,thus increases the diversity of the population.
- Mutation is determined by the mutation rate/probability, pm. The mutation probability/mutation rate, pm is usually small.

**Types of mutation methods:**

**1. uniform (random) mutation**

**2. inorder mutation**

### 5. Replacement of Population
- In this step, all the children are used as the current generation to replace the parent population.
- Children and parents are then selected based on fitness.

### 6. Termination
Step 3,4 and 5 are repeated until terminiation criteria is met. Below are the criterias for termination of the genetic algorithm process.

- The process has found an acceptable solution.
- The chromosome has a fitness function value which very little to no change intermination due to no improvement is observed over a number of consecutive
generations.
- A fixed number of generations have been set and the process terminates due to exceeding a set number of iterations.
